Almost 400 tracks were left by animals, including a wild ass, a giant buffalo, elephants, and camels. Only seven were confidently identified as human footprints.

They pledged shares at higher market capitalization to raise huge sums of money to stay ahead in the madness of creating market capitalization. Money was raised till their necks, and later used to buy helicopters, yachts and other luxuries in the name of business. We as investors were happy because of the self-created illusion of assets.

But the global economic crisis 2008-09 cracked the collective illusion of all analysts, investors and promoters. It is hard to know if promoters have learned their lesson, but, as an investor we have to learn a key lesson that assets which are not backed by sound business plans and cash flows are bound to become liabilities. Many of those so-called acquisitions are now bleeding. Moreover, money raised for these acquisitions and goodwill created in the accounts have turned into liabilities, which in many cases is larger than the net worth of these companies. Unwanted capacity expansion and unrelated diversifications are now eating into profits. In some of these cases the value of these assets is less than the cost at which they were acquired, which makes them liabilities. Would you agree how many power projects have become unviable and acquired coal mines have become liabilities rather than assets? We keep on hearing construction companies crying to sell projects to pay off assets turned liabilities. Today if you ask an analyst the value of those assets created in the boom time they will tell you it has negative value as they expect a negative contribution from these assets. Does this not mean that assets have turned into liabilities? In many cases equity invested in these assets has been (net worth) eroded and assets are now owned by banks. Promoters who were qualifying those acquisitions of assets and businesses as “best fit” and “a natural extension” to their businesses are now calling them non-core assets.",1617,267,6

A value investor will simply avoid a growth-hungry management that risks its core business and finances. Creation of assets in terms of huge capacity, acquiring big company does not ensure returns to shareholders. Today many companies have excess capacities and the new capacities are not utilised. On top of that servicing the debt has become a huge problem. Those forecasts of extraordinary profits have turned into extraordinary losses. One solution to this, as many value investors will agree, is to keep a tap on historical financials and pay more attention to its current earning capacity. One needs to ask if valuations tilted more towards future.",1007,159,6

Splitting businesses and listing them separately has certainly transferred money into promoters’ pockets but shareholders are left with the liability of owning them. We now see many companies reporting profits on a standalone basis but huge losses when results of subsidiaries and other businesses are consolidated.

1138,48,Balance Sheet: Analyzing Owners' Equity,Financial_Performance,"Capital in excess of par value is also known as paid-in capital. This figure represents the premium overstated par value (the $8 million) at which the original shares were issued. In the literal sense, it truly represents the capital “paid in” by early-round investors, or capital contributed by owners. This comes primarily in the form of common stock but can also include other related securities, such as preference shares or preferred stock.

1140,48,Balance Sheet: Analyzing Owners' Equity,Financial_Performance,"Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is worthy of its own analysis and is a very insightful line item that is best seen as a more expansive view of reported net income on the profit and loss statement. It represents net income plus other comprehensive income. So, this covers items that don’t flow directly through the income statement. For instance, for financial firms such as Berkshire that own large insurance operations, AOCI gives details on unrealized gains and losses in the investment portfolio.

1155,48,Balance Sheet: Analyzing Owners' Equity,Financial_Performance,"Warren Buffett has detailed that book value growth has been a conservative measure. This is because Berkshire's profits are taxed over time—shareholders can and have owned the stock for many years, avoiding taxes as unrealized long-term gains build.

1200,52,Shareholder Equity – SE Definition,Financial_Performance,"For corporations, shareholder equity (SE), also referred to as shareholders' equity and stockholders' equity, is the corporation's owners' residual claim on assets after debts have been paid. Equity is equal to a firm's total assets minus its total liabilities.",261,39,13
1201,52,Shareholder Equity – SE Definition,Financial_Performance,"Retained earnings is part of shareholder equity and is the percentage of net earnings that were not paid to shareholders as dividends. Retained earnings should not be confused with cash or other liquid assets. This is because years of retained earnings could be used for either expenses or any asset type to grow the business. Shareholders’ equity for a company that is a going concern is not the same as liquidation value. In liquidation, physical asset values have been reduced and other extraordinary conditions exist.",521,85,13

1207,52,Shareholder Equity – SE Definition,Financial_Performance,"For some purposes, such as dividends and earnings per share, a more relevant measure is shares “issued and outstanding.” This measure excludes Treasury Shares (stock owned by the company itself).",195,30,13
1210,52,Shareholder Equity – SE Definition,Financial_Performance,"Shareholder equity can be either negative or positive. If positive, the company has enough assets to cover its liabilities. If negative, the company's liabilities exceed its assets; if prolonged, this is considered balance sheet insolvency.",240,35,13
1211,52,Shareholder Equity – SE Definition,Financial_Performance,"For this reason, many investors view companies with negative shareholder equity as risky or unsafe investments. Shareholder equity alone is not a definitive indicator of a company's financial health; used in conjunction with other tools and metrics, the investor can accurately analyze the health of an organization.",316,47,13
1212,52,Shareholder Equity – SE Definition,Financial_Performance,"All the information needed to compute a company's shareholder equity is available on its balance sheet. Total assets include current and non-current assets. Current assets are assets that can be converted to cash within a year (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory, et al.). Long-term assets are assets that cannot be converted to cash or consumed within a year (e.g. investments; property, plant, and equipment; and intangibles, such as patents).",453,69,13
1213,52,Shareholder Equity – SE Definition,Financial_Performance,"Total liabilities consist of current and long-term liabilities. Current liabilities are debts typically due for repayment within one year (e.g. accounts payable and taxes payable). Long-term liabilities are obligations that are due for repayment in periods longer than one year (e.g., bonds payable, leases, and pension obligations). Upon calculating the total assets and liabilities, shareholder equity can be determined.",422,59,13
1214,52,Shareholder Equity – SE Definition,Financial_Performance,"Shareholder equity is an important metric in determining the return being generated versus the total amount invested by equity investors. For example, ratios like return on equity (ROE), which is the result of a company's net income divided by shareholder equity, is used to measure how well a company's management is using its equity from investors to generate profit.",369,59,13

1245,54,"The Fed's new frontier: What happens, why it matters and what could go wrong",Financial_Performance,"Consider the Federal Reserve the Starship Enterprise of monetary policy: It went where no central bank had gone before, and now must plot the journey home. The Fed already has begun one leg of the trip, as it has started raising interest rates from financial crisis-era lows. Now, it is preparing to embark on what could be the more perilous part — unwinding the $4.5 trillion of bonds it holds on its so-called balance sheet. Central bank officials discussed in March how to address the balance sheet, according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee released Wednesday. While it may just sound like arcane monetary talk, the stakes are high both for investors and consumers. Get it right, and the Fed will have pulled off what its critics thought impossible, namely embarking on unprecedented intervention in the markets with little consequence. Get it wrong and the fallout could be dramatic, including a sharp rise in interest rates and tumult in the stock and bond markets.",987,166,5
1247,54,"The Fed's new frontier: What happens, why it matters and what could go wrong",Financial_Performance,"The Fed's balance sheet in total now runs $4.52 trillion, composed primarily of various bonds. Of the total, $3.7 trillion came during three rounds of buying that began in response to the Great Recession of 2007-09. The program, known as ""quantitative easing"" or, more colloquially, ""money printing,"" was aimed at injecting money into the economy and encouraging risk-taking following the devastation of the financial crisis. The Fed bought Treasurys, now totaling $2.46 trillion, and mortgage-backed securities — loans packaged together as bonds now valued at $1.77 trillion — and they will be the focus of the balance sheet operation. Those bonds carry various maturity dates. When the bonds reach maturity, current policy entails reinvesting the proceeds and rolling over the bonds. That helps keep demand in the market for government bonds and holds rates low.",864,135,5
1249,54,"The Fed's new frontier: What happens, why it matters and what could go wrong",Financial_Performance,"When deciding how to unload the balance sheet, the Fed has two choices: It can simply allow the bonds to run off naturally, or it can actively sell them back into the market before maturity. Given the choice, Fed officials very much prefer the former option of not reinvesting the proceeds; the latter could create a supply glut and jack up rates. There's another question: timing. Will the Fed choose to gradually stop reinvesting — ""tapering,"" in Fed parlance — or stop all at once? The meeting minutes show considerable disagreement over how officials believe the process should occur. And finally, FOMC officials will have to decide whether it will stop reinvesting both its mortgage and Treasury holdings. The likelihood is that the greater focus will be on mortgages, but that, too, likely will be the subject of much debate ahead.",837,141,5
1251,54,"The Fed's new frontier: What happens, why it matters and what could go wrong",Financial_Performance,"Both the stock and bond markets have come to depend on the Fed's programs — both the low interest rates and the balance sheet expansion — in the post-crisis years. Stocks, as measured by the , have surged more than 250 percent since the recession lows, while interest rates have remained low across the spectrum. Any fiddling with a $4.5 trillion batch of bonds, then, could have major consequences if it's not done the right way. Fed critics have worried for years that the central bank's reluctance to unwind crisis-era policies long after the crisis passed poses substantial dangers. The day is coming, then, when that will be put to the test. ""I have a bridge to sell you if you think a rate hike cycle combined with a shrinking balance sheet will go smoothly,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. ""If the exit process ends up turning messy — defined as a recession and bear market in stocks — was all this easing worth it? Be bullish if you think both news stories will turn out just fine. Be very worried if they don't.""",1054,189,5
1253,54,"The Fed's new frontier: What happens, why it matters and what could go wrong",Financial_Performance,"There are a few reasons why the balance sheet discussion reflected in the minutes was such a big deal. The FOMC's statement after the March meeting made no mention that the issue was discussed in such detail, and Chair Janet Yellen had little to say about it in her news conference afterward as well. The market is left, then, to parse out how soon it must worry about balance sheet reduction. The minutes pointed to a move later this year. That jibes with a projection from Bank of America Merrill Lynch that balance sheet reduction will start when the Fed's benchmark target rate is around 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent — or two rate hikes from now, which is the baseline projection for 2017 both from central bank officials and market participants. From there, BofAML thinks the Fed will taper its reinvestments over a one-year period and continue down a passive path. ""The Fed has stated its intention to reduce its securities holdings by simply not rolling over its maturing proceeds,"" BofAML rates strategist Mark Cabana said in a note. ""The Fed will likely not engage in asset sales as a core part of the reduction process."" However, there's one other question: Will the Fed keep raising rates at the same time, or will it use the balance sheet reduction as the equivalent of several hikes? Cabana believes the rate hikes will continue, though New York Fed President William Dudley has said he believes the Fed could pause as it runs off the balance sheet.",1461,255,5

The IPO suspension of Chinese tech giant Alibaba’s Ant Group, merely two days before its scheduled dual listing on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges drew global attention. Some argued that the IPO suspension represents Beijing’s humbling of a powerful company and its outspoken leader, asserting the authority of the state above all (Jing Daily, November 3; Nikkei Asia, November 18). Others viewed the suspension as a long-awaited regulatory crackdown, arguing that Ant functioned for too long as a quasi-bank under the guise of a technology company to dodge the scrutiny of financial regulations (Caixin, November 9; see also China Brief, December 8). The era of regulatory arbitrage appears to have ended, with China’s economic leadership beginning to respond to the reality that financial technology (fintech) corporations will shape the future of financial services.

As Walter and Howie have observed, although all SOEs are “owned” and managed by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), China’s banks have been the historic exception to this reality, and in practice sit within the state’s organizational hierarchy as vice-ministerial entities.[2]",678,93,20

Beijing’s investment-stimulated economic growth model is dependent on its tight rein over the banking sector. Another factor for China’s growth is one of the highest national saving rates in the world, which means that, apart from government funding, Beijing has a surplus of public capital available for use. Zhou Xiaochuan, Vice Chairman of the Bo’ao Forum for Asia and Former President of the People’s Bank of China, recently commented that China’s GDP savings rate has been consistently higher than the global average rate of 26.5 percent over the past two decades (Economic Daily News, October 24). At the end of 2019, China’s savings rate was 44.6 percent. Before the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) of 1997-1998, China’s savings rate was around 35 percent. After the AFC, it increased rapidly to 51.8 percent during the GFC (CEIC, undated). China’s high national savings rate also explains how it has been able to pledge more than $1 trillion in investments along the core diplomatic and economic policy Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), even though its per capita GDP is not high.[3] Put simply, Beijing has the money, and the drive to use it.",1262,208,20
1495,67,Understanding the Financial Picture Behind Ant’s IPO Suspension,Financial_Performance,"The downside of Beijing’s power over banks is that the central and local governments tell banks to loan to state-driven projects or SOEs by administrative fiat, without considering their future profits or repayment capabilities. This has caused a great many issues for the Chinese economy, which are acknowledged internally. For example, Premier Li Keqiang has said that banks should not favor SOEs and should treat all types of ownership enterprises equally (Gov.cn, September 29, 2018).

This is a strong indicator of the poor quality of its previous investments. Ma Guonan, a fellow at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, found that China had the fastest growing ratio of corporate debt to GDP in the world, and that its corporate debt rose by 65 percent following the 2008 global financial crisis.[4] A 2019 OECD working paper found that China’s SOEs account for over three quarters of its debt in 2017.[5] Chinese SOEs dependent on government subsidies or bank loans to stay alive are popularly called “zombie enterprises” even in official Chinese media (People’s Daily, January 4, 2016). Understandably, in 2019 the powerful National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) issued a reform plan to speed up the improvement of the SOE exit system, promoting bankruptcy and the restructuring of state-owned zombies as part of a greater drive to decrease debt (NDRC, July 16, 2019).",1185,193,20

Current vice-premier Liu He, generally thought to be the man in charge of China’s economy, is thought to have commented more boldly (albeit cloaked under a veil of anonymity) that economic downturns or social unemployment were less risky for China’s overall economy than the state’s poor control over its highly leveraged assets (People’s Daily, May 9).

However, we continue to do our part to keep people safe and help rebuild the economy.

Spot prices holding, and long-term fundamentals remain strong: Low uranium prices, government-driven trade policies and the COVID-19 pandemic are having an effect on the security of supply in our industry. In addition to the supply curtailments that have occurred in the industry for many years, we have seen a number of unplanned supply disruptions since March, including our suspension at the Cigar Lake mine and the reduction in operational activities across all mines in Kazakhstan. The duration and extent of these disruptions are still unknown. Following the announcements, the uranium spot price initially increased by more than 35%. Recently prices have held at a level that is averaging close to $10 (US) per pound higher than spot prices in 2019. As noted recently by the International Atomic Energy Agency, while electricity demand in the near-term has declined, the proportion of nuclear power has increased relative to fossil fuel sources which demonstrates the resilience of the clean, carbon-free, base-load electricity generation that nuclear power provides.",1793,287,36

They come in different forms: Fines are fixed financial penalties for given offenses, fees are charges for costs of using the justice system—and surcharges are levied on top of those—as a percentage of the total cost.

2168,89,Transfer of real property to a first-degree relative is not a transfer of ownership,Financial_Performance,"Recall that real property in Michigan has a Stave Equalized Value (SEV) and a Taxable Value (TV) (in addition to an assessed value). The SEV is calculated annually as one-half of a property’s true cash value. The SEV moves up or down with changes in the real estate market. The TV is the value used to calculate property taxes. Over a period of time with increasing property values, the SEV increases faster than the TV, because the TV is ‘capped’ and can only increase annually by the rate of inflation or 5 percent, whichever is less. In time, a sizeable gap between the two values can develop. If the ownership of a property changes and the SEV has outpaced the TV, the change of ownership ‘uncaps’ the TV to increase to the SEV at the time of transfer and the new owner will pay higher property taxes on the uncapped TV.",824,151,6

The SBA used its preexisting forms and operating procedures for the 7(a) program when establishing PPP loans. SBA loan servicing guidelines for the 7(a) program provide that SBA lenders must obtain the prior approval of the SBA in respect of certain transactions, including (1) any proposed change in the ownership of a borrower in the first 12 months after loan disbursement, and (2) any transfers of at least 90% of a loan and/or a release of the original PPP borrower. PPP lenders were not permitted to unilaterally consent to these transactions. The existing 7(a) guidelines left “change of ownership” undefined, other than to provide that any change of ownership, even a change in the percentage of ownership held by various owners, would trigger the prior SBA approval requirement. PPP loans are unsecured loans. As a result, acquisitions of all or substantially all of a PPP borrower’s business by way of an asset sale in which the loan was excluded from the sale and left behind with the borrower/seller were not expressly subject to the SBA prior approval requirement.",1171,194,29

4181,500,10 Things You Should Know About Prohibition,SuspectAct,"In the early 19th century, religious revivalists and early teetotaler groups like the American Temperance Society campaigned relentlessly against what they viewed as a nationwide scourge of drunkenness. The activists scored a major victory in 1851, when the Maine legislature passed a statewide prohibition on selling alcohol. A dozen other states soon instituted “Maine Laws” of their own, only to repeal them a few years later after widespread opposition and riots from grog-loving citizens (Kansas later instituted a separate ban in 1881). Calls for a “dry” America continued into the 1910s, when deep-pocketed and politically connected groups such as the Anti-Saloon League and the Women's Christian Temperance Union gained widespread support for anti-alcohol legislation on Capitol Hill.",792,117,10
4183,500,10 Things You Should Know About Prohibition,SuspectAct,"Prohibition was all but sealed by the time the United States entered World War I in 1917, but the conflict served as one of the last nails in the coffin of legalized alcohol. Dry advocates argued that the barley used in brewing beer could be made into bread to feed American soldiers and war-ravaged Europeans, and they succeeded in winning wartime bans on strong drink. Anti-alcohol crusaders were often fueled by xenophobia, and the war allowed them to paint America's largely German brewing industry as a threat. “We have German enemies in this country, too,” one temperance politician argued. “And the worst of all our German enemies, the most treacherous, the most menacing, are Pabst, Schlitz, Blatz and Miller.”",718,119,10
4185,500,10 Things You Should Know About Prohibition,SuspectAct,"The 18th Amendment only forbade the “manufacture, sale and transportation of intoxicating liquors”—not their consumption. By law, any wine, beer or spirits Americans had stashed away in January 1920 were theirs to keep and enjoy in the privacy of their homes. For most, this amounted to only a few bottles, but some affluent drinkers built cavernous wine cellars and even bought out whole liquor store inventories to ensure they had healthy stockpiles of legal hooch.",467,75,10
4187,500,10 Things You Should Know About Prohibition,SuspectAct,"Along with creating an army of federal agents, the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act stipulated that individual states should enforce Prohibition within their own borders. Governors resented the added strain on their public coffers, however, and many neglected to appropriate any money toward policing the alcohol ban. Maryland never even enacted an enforcement code, and eventually earned a reputation as one of the most stubbornly anti-Prohibition states in the Union. New York followed suit and repealed its measures in 1923, and other states grew increasingly lackadaisical as the decade wore on. “National prohibition went into legal effect upward of six years ago,” Maryland Senator William Cabell Bruce told Congress in the mid-1920s, “but it can be truly said that, except to a highly qualified extent, it has never gone into practical effect at all.”",861,135,10
4190,500,10 Things You Should Know About Prohibition,SuspectAct,"The Volstead Act included a few interesting exceptions to the ban on distributing alcohol. Sacramental wine was still permitted for religious purposes (the number of questionable rabbis and priests soon skyrocketed), and drug stores were allowed to sell “medicinal whiskey” to treat everything from toothaches to the flu. With a physician's prescription, “patients” could legally buy a pint of hard liquor every ten days. This pharmaceutical booze often came with seemingly laughable doctor's orders such as “Take three ounces every hour for stimulant until stimulated.” Many speakeasies eventually operated under the guise of being pharmacies, and legitimate chains flourished. According to Prohibition historian Daniel Okrent, windfalls from legal alcohol sales helped the drug store chain Walgreens grow from around 20 locations to more than 500 during the 1920s.",866,128,10
4192,500,10 Things You Should Know About Prohibition,SuspectAct,"While many small distilleries and breweries continued to operate in secret during Prohibition, the rest had to either shut their doors or find new uses for their factories. Yuengling and Anheuser Busch both refitted their breweries to make ice cream, while Coors doubled down on the production of pottery and ceramics. Others produced “near beer”—legal brew that contained less than 0.5 percent alcohol. The lion's share of brewers kept the lights on by peddling malt syrup, a legally dubious extract that could be easily made into beer by adding water and yeast and allowing time for fermentation. Winemakers followed a similar route by selling chunks of grape concentrate called “wine bricks.”",695,111,10
4194,500,10 Things You Should Know About Prohibition,SuspectAct,"Enterprising bootleggers produced millions of gallons of “bathtub gin” and rotgut moonshine during Prohibition. This illicit hooch had a famously foul taste, and those desperate enough to drink it also ran the risk of being struck blind or even poisoned. The most deadly tinctures contained industrial alcohol originally made for use in fuels and medical supplies. The federal government had required companies to denature industrial alcohol to make it undrinkable as early as 1906, but during Prohibition it ordered them to add quinine, methyl alcohol and other toxic chemicals as a further deterrent. Coupled with the other low-quality products on offer from bootleggers, this tainted booze may have killed more than 10,000 people before the repeal of the 18th Amendment.",773,120,10
4196,500,10 Things You Should Know About Prohibition,SuspectAct,"By the late 1920s, Americans were spending more money than ever on black market booze. New York City boasted more than 30,000 speakeasies, and Detroit's alcohol trade was second only to the auto industry in its contribution to the economy. With the country bogged down by the Great Depression, anti-Prohibition activists argued that potential savings and tax revenue from alcohol were too precious to ignore. The public agreed. After Franklin D. Roosevelt called for a repeal during the 1932 presidential campaign, he won the election in a landslide. Prohibition was dead a year later, when a majority of states ratified the 21st Amendment repealing the 18th. In New Orleans, the decision was honored with 20 minutes of celebratory cannon fire. Roosevelt supposedly marked the occasion by downing a dirty martini.",813,130,10

If you're wondering why the shell company, described as Business Insider as acting “almost like a campaign within a campaign” was necessary, well, it's not entirely clear, but it sure sounds like the express purpose was the ability to shield “financial and operational details from public scrutiny,” as it allowed the campaign to avoid federally mandated disclosures concerning what it was spending considerable amounts of money on.

Some of those same advisers said they didn't learn about John Pence's and Lara Trump's involvement until Insider contacted them for this story. Campaign-law experts have long accused the Trump team of using a corporate pass-through to hide payments. The nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, led by former Republican Federal Election Commission Chairman Trevor Potter, filed a civil complaint with the FEC in July accusing the Trump campaign of “disguising” about $170 million worth of campaign spending in large part “by laundering the funds” through AMMC.

6191,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"Just two weeks ago, in February 2019, an extensive investigation by the Swedish broadcaster SVT revealed that at least US$5.8 billion of the dirty money that passed through Danske Bank came from another Nordic bank, Swedbank. This Swedish bank allegedly allowed transactions from 50 of its suspicious accounts for nearly a decade. Money was funneled through all three Baltic branches, including Lithuania — where an alleged bribe of US$4.2 million was transferred for the ultimate benefit of Ukraine's corrupt ex-president Viktor Yanukovych.",541,82,25
6192,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"In response to the findings, the Bank of Lithuania — the country's central bank — stated that it has “a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering” and will help Estonian and Swedish authorities uncover the truth. The Bank of Lithuania also insisted that the country's share of non-resident clients that may potentially pose a money laundering risk is one of the lowest in the EU; and that “factual data shows that the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing in Lithuania is not high”.",495,83,25
6193,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"The latest mutual evaluation of Lithuania conducted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — an international body responsible for setting anti-money laundering standards — partially confirms this statement. The evaluation shows that after ŪKIO bankas went bankrupt in 2013, the number of bank accounts held by non-residents, considered as high-risk for money laundering, dropped dramatically. Before 2013, ŪKIO bankas accounted for a significant share of Lithuania's non-resident customers.",494,69,25
6194,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"According to this week's investigation by OCCRP, some of these non-resident customers were linked to a massive money laundering scheme, the Troika Laundromat. The scheme operated from inside the Russian investment bank Troika Dialog and involved more than 70 offshore companies registered in places such as the British Virgin Islands and Panama. At least 35 of these companies had accounts with ŪKIO bankas in Lithuania and were used to move more than US$4.6 billion between 2006 and early 2013.",495,79,25
6195,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"The findings of the OCCRP investigation raises questions as to whether anti-money laundering supervision in Lithuania is fit for purpose.

6197,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"If the value of transactions and number of accounts — at least 35 accounts belonging to companies registered in tax havens — were not enough to raise suspicions, there were other elements that should have. Documents reviewed by OCCRP show that the registered beneficial owners for many of the accounts were seasonal workers from Armenia. If the bank followed a proper due diligence process, they surely would have found that these individuals did not match the profile of a company owner involved in million-dollar transactions in another jurisdiction.",552,88,25
6198,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"The purpose of these transactions was not always very convincing either, as documented in the written exchange between ŪKIO employees. Inexplicably, the transactions weren't stopped and no suspicious activities seem to have been reported by the bank.",250,37,25
6199,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"Considering that the bank in question held most of the high-risk non-resident accounts in the country, the low number of submitted suspicious transaction reports should have served as a warning sign to the authorities.",218,34,25

6201,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"Lithuanian authorities looked closer at ŪKIO at least one more time. When the bank went bankrupt in 2013, the circumstances around its insolvency led the authorities to investigate whether it had been defrauded. The Bank of Lithuania found that the main owner of ŪKIO had embezzled the bank's money using three fake loans and shell companies. The embezzled funds were sent out of the country and the owner fled to Russia. The investigation led to the sanctioning of ŪKIO's external auditor Deloitte and the loss of license for one of its auditors. But even then, the authorities do not seem to have extended their investigations to look at bank's other business.",662,111,25
6203,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,The Bank of Lithuania is responsible for prudential and anti-money laundering supervision of financial institutions. The Bank of Lithuania supervises 470 financial market participants — including banks — using risk-based supervision. This type of supervisory approach conforms with best practice but is only effective if (a) there is a good understanding of risks and (b) actions are taken to mitigate these and detect potential wrongdoing.,440,65,25
6204,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"While there is a recognition that the Bank of Lithuania has made noteworthy improvements in the last two years, recent anti-money laundering reviews conducted by FATF and OECD show that significant shortcomings remain, particularly related to risk-based supervision and level of resources available to supervisory bodies.",321,46,25
6205,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"In 2014–2015, key government bodies such as the Financial Crime Investigation Service and the Bank of Lithuania, carried out Lithuania's anti-money laundering risk assessment. The report, however, does not address the risks around cross-border illicit payments, particularly those from and to higher risk countries. According to the 2018 FATF evaluation, this gap still impacts authorities' current understanding of money laundering vulnerabilities in the country. Further, the Bank of Lithuania seems to primarily rely on off-site inspections that draw on annual reports submitted by the financial institutions.",612,86,25
6206,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"In higher risk cases, this approach might not be sufficient. Preventive random on-site inspections should be the norm to review whether financial institutions are complying with their anti-money laundering obligations and detecting any suspicious activity. In a 2017 evaluation, the OECD concluded that inspections of financial institutions in Lithuania appear insufficient. The report recommends that the Bank of Lithuania allocate sufficient resources to ensure more rigorous supervision of reporting entities.",512,70,25
6207,556,Lithuania's money laundering problem,SuspectAct,"The issue of resources is also raised in the FATF assessment, although the report recognises that the Bank of Lithuania has demonstrated a strong commitment during the last two years, in particular to increasing its resource capacity, so as to continue to move towards comprehensive risk-based supervision. As of December 2017, the Bank of Lithuania had seven staff members allocated to the supervision of anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing systems, information technology and operational risk in all financial market participants. This number is hardly sufficient to effectively supervise the 470 entities under its responsibility, particularly considering that their use of automated processes in investigations is limited.",744,107,25

Serious steps need to be taken to ensure Lithuania's financial system cannot be misused by criminals as an entry point to the EU financial market. The authorities should thoroughly investigate the freshly unearthed schemes, identify suspicions accounts and transactions and take the necessary measures to sanction those involved. Next, Lithuanian financial supervisors must share their findings with other countries so that further investigations can be conducted into the origin and final destination of the money that passed through ŪKIO and Swedbank.",639,94,25

This meant that they imposed restrictions on exports but did not make it obligatory to declare drug use or cultivation illegal, let alone make these activities a criminal offence.

The purpose of the 1961 U nited Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs was to replace the previous international agreements that had been reached since the International Opium Convention in a not very systematic manner. It includes new provisions that did not appear in the previous treaties, and thus creates a unified, universal system of drug control.

The Single Convention set the target of abolishing traditional uses of opium within 15 years, and traditional uses of coca and cannabis within 25 years. Given that the Convention entered into force in December 1964, the 15-year period for gradually eliminating opium use came to an end in 1979, while the 25-year deadline for coca and cannabis expired in 1989.

With regard to Schedule IV narcotics in particular, Article 2, 5 (b) of the Convention says that “A Party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in, possession or use of any such drug except for the amounts which may be necessary for medical and scientific research only…”.",879,140,114
7579,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"It is important to highlight that, according to the Convention, the three plants also have licit purposes (medicinal, but also horticultural and industrial purposes) under certain conditions – see articles 21 bis to 28, which clarify these conditions. Article 23 also requires countries to set up a “government agency” to take charge of controlling the licit cultivation of opium poppy for medicines, and Articles 26 and 28 say that the same system of controls should also be applied to licit coca and cannabis cultivation. As for the coca leaf, Article 26 also says that “The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated.” Further information on how exactly the Convention deals with these three substances can be found in the same articles 21 bis to 28.",860,143,114
7580,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The fact that special provisions on the cannabis plant, the opium poppy and the coca bush are included in the text of the treaty makes it more difficult to ease controls by only reclassifying them in the Schedules by means of the usual process, as described in Article 3 of the Convention. A country or the World Health Organisation (WHO) can propose to review a substance to consider its removal from the Schedules or move it to another one when they have information justifying such a rescheduling. In the case of cannabis, opium poppy and coca, a removal from the Schedules would not immediately end all international control and an amendment to the text of the treaty may be required as well.",696,122,114

7583,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The idea of negotiating this new treaty was to respond to the diversification of drug use, with the objective of controlling a whole new range of psychoactive substances (which became fashionable in the 1960s) such as amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and psychedelic drugs, which were likewise classified in four Schedules.",334,49,114
7584,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"During the negotiations on the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances , it became evident that pressure was being exerted by the large pharmaceutical industry in Europe and the United States, which feared that its products would be brought under the same strict controls as those established by the Single Convention. The need for a new treaty was argued on the basis of a (scientifically questionable) distinction between the 'narcotics' controlled by the 1961 Convention and the so-called 'psychotropic substances', an invented concept without a clear definition. According to an employee of the UN Division of Narcotic Drugs and secretary of the Technical Committee of the Plenipotentiary Conference at the time: “The most important manufacturing and exporting countries tried everything to restrict the scope of control to the minimum and weaken the control measures in such a way that they should not hinder the free international trade… .” Compared to the strict controls that the Single Convention's Schedules imposed on drugs derived from plants, the 1971 treaty established a less rigid control structure, except for Schedule I.",1141,176,114
7585,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Schedule I includes substances said to pose a serious risk to public health, which are not currently recognised by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) as having any therapeutic value. These include synthetic psychedelics such as LSD and MDMA, commonly known as Ecstasy. Schedule II includes amphetamine-type stimulants considered to have limited therapeutic value, as well as some analgesics and dronabinol* or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), an important ingredient in cannabis. Schedule III includes barbiturate products with fast or average effects, which have been the object of serious abuse despite being therapeutically useful, as well as flunitrazepam and some analgesics such as buprenorphine. Schedule IV includes some weaker barbiturates such as phenobarbital, other hypnotics, hypnotic anxiolytics, benzodiazepines and some weaker stimulants.",853,119,114
7588,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Dronabinol (delta-9-THC), one of the active ingredients in cannabis was initially included in Schedule I (the most restrictive) but, following a recommendation by the WHO, in 1991 the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) reclassified it to Schedule II. Later scientific research by the WHO on dronabinolled the organisation to recommend a new reclassification in 2002 to move the substance into Schedule IV (the least restrictive).",429,65,114

7594,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The 1988 Convention came about in the framework of the political, historical and sociological context of the 1970s and 1980s, leading to the adoption of more repressive measures. The increase in demand for cannabis, cocaine and heroin for non-medical purposes mainly in the developed world gave rise to large-scale illicit production in the countries where these plants had traditionally been grown, in order to supply the market. International drug trafficking quickly became a multi-billion-dollar business controlled by criminal groups. This rapid expansion of the illicit drug trade became the justification for intensifying a battle that soon became an all-out war on drugs. In the United States, which was the fastest-growing market for controlled substances, the political response was to declare war on the supply from abroad rather than analysing and addressing the causes of the burgeoning demand at home.",915,139,114
7595,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The term “war on drugs” was coined in 1971 by President Richard Nixon, making drugs (including their use) “public enemy number one” for the US. The first target in this war was Mexico, a country that had supplied the 1960s counter-cultural revolution with huge quantities of illegally-produced cannabis, and by 1974 had also become the main source of heroin for the US market. But the first military counternarcotic operations in this war took place in the Andes, with the deployment of US army special forces to provide training on how to destroy coca crops, cocaine laboratories and drug trafficking networks. The weakening of the fight against world communism and the end of the cold war in the late 1980s freed up large quantities of military assets that were then re-assigned to the war on drugs.",801,135,114

It was at this time, under significant pressure from the US for the rest of the world to join it in the war on drugs, that the United Nations convened another conference to negotiate what would become the Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 . The treaty obliged countries to impose criminal sanctions to combat all aspects of illicit drug production, possession and trafficking. It established special measures against the illicit cultivation, production, possession and trafficking of psychoactive substances and the diversion of precursor chemicals, as well as an agreement on mutual legal assistance, including extradition. Annexed to the 1988 Convention are two tables listing precursor chemicals, reagents and solvents which are frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.",1047,156,114

Thus, drug use is not mentioned among the 'penal provisions' in the Single Convention (Article 36), or in the 1971 Convention (Article 22), or in Article 3 (Offences and Sanctions) of the 1988 Convention. This is related, firstly, to the fact that the treaties do not require countries to 'prohibit' any of the classified substances in themselves. The treaties only establish a system of strict legal control of the production and supply of all the controlled drugs for medical and scientific purposes, as well as introducing sanctions aimed at combating the illicit production and distribution of these same substances for other purposes.",734,119,114
7602,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The 1961 Convention only requires that the use of the drugs in Schedule IV (the most restrictive in this treaty) be prohibited if the Party should determine that “the prevailing conditions in its country” mean that this is “the most appropriate means of protecting the public health and welfare” (Article 2 § 5 b). The 1971 Convention uses more robust terms than its predecessor, by prohibiting any use of the controlled substances in Schedule I (the most restrictive in this treaty) except for scientific purposes and “very limited medical purposes” (Articles 5 and 7), without mentioning whether this depends on its being “the most appropriate means” to protect public health.",678,110,114
7603,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Drug use was deliberately omitted from the articles listing the drug-related acts that must be declared a criminal offence. There is no doubt, then, that the UN conventions do not oblige countries to impose any penalty (criminal or administrative) for drug use as such. This is explicitly stated in the Commentary to the 1988 Convention regarding Article 3 of the Convention on “Offences and Sanctions”: “It will be noted that, as with the 1961 and 1971 Conventions, paragraph 2 does not require drug consumption as such to be established as a punishable offence”. The 1988 Convention does stipulate that a member state should consider possession for personal use as a crime but, even so, this provision is “subject to its constitutional principles and the basic concepts of its legal system”.

7604,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The conventions are more restrictive with regard to possession, acquisition, or growing for personal use. Article 33 of the 1961 Single Convention says that “The Parties shall not permit the possession of drugs except under legal authority” (and, in such authorised cases, solely for medical and scientific purposes) while Article 36, paragraph 1, obliges the Parties to declare possession a punishable offence. With regard to the obligation to criminalize possession, it is important to point out that a distinction is made between possession for personal use and possession for trafficking. The Convention's emphasis on tackling trafficking may be understood to indicate that countries are not obliged by virtue of Article 36 of the 1961 Convention to declare simple possession a crime. This opinion is backed up by the history of the wording of Article 36, which was originally entitled “Measures against illicit traffickers”. A similar situation applies in the 1971 Convention, which takes its cue from the previous treaty.",1027,159,114

The treaties do not suggest that human rights principles should be infringed, but in the name of drug control fundamental rights (as established in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights) are being violated all over the world, including the right to life and to health, the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel treatment, the right to due process, the right to be free from discrimination, the economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples, and children's rights, among others.",811,131,114

In Southeast Asia and China, hundreds of thousands of people are held for months – and sometimes years – in compulsory detention centres for drug users, where they are supposed to be given 'treatment'.

7659,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The purpose of all these efforts is to de-escalate the war on drugs and to 'humanise' drug control policies. In the last few years, this reformist tendency has become particularly evident in some Latin American countries, where major proposals to reform drug control laws have been implemented recently or are being discussed.",326,52,114
7660,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"But although these reforms have provoked tensions with the treaty system, they are all justifiable within the existing flexibility of the treaties and they represent a gradual change in the way the treaties are being interpreted, taking advantage of the gaps and ambiguities in their text.",289,46,114
7661,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"There are however also clearly established limits to the latitude of the treaties; especially the legal regulation under state control of a market for recreational purposes falls outside the realm of interpreting the treaties in good faith. For that, changes of the treaty obligations are required, either by amendments to the conventions themselves or by exceptions for specific countries via reservations. The most relevant case of the latter is Bolivia: because of its interest in defending the traditional uses of coca leaf, the country withdrew in 2011 from the 1961 Convention and later re-adhered to it with a reservation allowing the domestic legal coca market to persist. While the move was contested by the INCB on dubious grounds, and the G8 countries and a few others formally objected to Bolivia's reservation, the procedure was accepted by the UN, creating a precedent that could be used in other circumstances.",925,148,114
7664,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"As the first UN World Drug Report stated in 1997, “Laws – and even the international Conventions – are not written in stone; they can be changed when the democratic will of nations so wishes it.” Argentina recently echoed that statement at the General Assembly in May 2015 : ""Let's not be afraid to debate… even about the conventions that apparently need to be untouchable. The conventions are not the Bible, they are just that, conventions, agreements, which should evolve as people and policies evolve"". Indeed, significant changes have already been made to them once, by the so-called 1972 Protocol which amended the 1961 Single Convention. Thus, the current text of the Single Convention is substantially different to what was agreed in 1961. Why would it be so inconceivable to do that again?",797,133,114
7665,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Most other international treaty regimes have built-in monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, for example regular Conferences of the Parties (COPs) to review implementation problems encountered by the parties. But the three drug control conventions lack such mechanisms to enable evolution of the system over time.",312,44,114
7666,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Until recently, even discussing a reform of the conventions was a political taboo that was informally accepted as necessary to preserve the delicate Vienna consensus in the area of drug control. Over the last decade, however, the cracks that have opened up in this consensus have widened, so much so that in the case of cannabis regulation in Uruguay and the US states of Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Alaska we can now talk in terms of breaches of the treaties. This shows that today's criticisms of the current international drug control framework are not confined to whispered conversations in the CND corridors but have entered the realm of radical policy shifts away from the treaty regime's prohibitionist paradigm.",724,118,114
7667,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Even so, a genuine process to review the conventions has not yet begun. The risk of delaying this step for too long is that the tensions between the conventions and the decisions and practices adopted by individual countries are becoming ever stronger, causing political friction between some nations and others, as well as between the UN bodies and those governments who have dared to propose and implement measures that conflict with the treaties. All this goes against what is after all the purpose of an international treaty: to reconcile differences and unite the community of nations around points of common agreement among them all, however difficult that may be.",670,109,114
7670,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"There are several ways to modify either the conventions themselves, the range of substances they control, or the obligations for a specific state party or for a group of countries. Putting in practice any of these options implies significant procedural complications and political obstacles. None of the options offers an easy escape from the demands of the current treaties, which prohibit a shift to legal regulation. For good reasons, therefore, a number of US states and Uruguay have moved forward with cannabis regulation before finding a legal solution to the problem of infringing the treaty system, and several more are likely to follow before any treaty reform actually takes place. As is often the case, a critical mass of discrepancy between law and practice needs to be reached before political conditions enable actual legislative reforms at the national or -even more so- at the international level.",913,146,114
7672,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Any state party can propose an amendment to the 1961, 1971 or 1988 Convention, and if such a proposed amendment has not been rejected by any party within 18 months (24 months in the case of the 1988 Convention), it automatically enters into force. If objections are submitted, ECOSOC must decide if a conference of the parties need be convened to negotiate the amendment.",371,64,114
7673,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Other options are less clear, but if only a few or minor objections are raised, the Council can decide to accept the amendment in the understanding it will not apply to those who explicitly rejected it. If a significant number of substantial objections are tabled, the Council can reject the proposed amendment. In the latter case, if the proposing party is not willing to accept the decision, it can either denounce the treaty or a dispute may arise which could ultimately “be referred to the International Court of Justice for decision” (Single Convention, Article 48).",571,95,114
7674,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,The amendment procedure has been invoked twice in the case of the drug control conventions: in 1972 a Conference of the Parties negotiated and adopted a whole series of substantial amendments to the 1961 Single Convention; and in 2009 Bolivia proposed an amendment to delete the obligation contained in article 49 to abolish coca chewing. The Bolivian amendment failed after 18 countries objected and Bolivia decided not to pursue the case but instead denounce the treaty and re-adhere with a reservation that had a similar effect but only for Bolivia.,552,90,114
7676,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"At the moment of signing, acceding or ratifying a treaty, states have the option to make reservations regarding specific provisions, as many countries in fact did in the case of all three drug control treaties [ reservations can be found in the UN Treaty Collection database ]. Reservations or other formal unilateral “interpretive declarations” are meant to exclude or modify the legal effect of certain provisions of a treaty for the reserving state.",452,73,114
7677,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The issuing of “late reservations” (after having already adhered to a treaty) has been subject to debate among legal scholars and in the UN International Law Commission, and current practice of the UN treaty depository is to only accept them if none of the other state parties object. The procedure of treaty denunciation followed by reaccession with reservation, as Bolivia did, is a legitimate procedure, although its practice in international law is limited to exceptional cases. According to Yale Law Professor Laurence R. Helfer , “a categorical ban on denunciation and reaccession with reservations would be unwise. Such a ban would [...] force states with strongly held objections to specific treaty rules to quit a treaty even when all states (and perhaps non-state actors as well) would be better off had the withdrawing state remained as a party. It would also remove a mechanism for reserving states to convey valuable and credible information to other parties regarding the nature and intensity of their objections to changed treaty commitments or changes in the state of the world that have rendered existing treaty rules problematic or inapposite.”",1162,185,114
7679,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The 1961 and 1971 conventions mandate the WHO to review substances and recommend their appropriate scheduling, weighing evidence of health risks against their medical usefulness. The treaties require the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), contrary to its current self-imposed modus operandi to negotiate resolutions until full consensus is reached, to vote on WHO recommendations .",382,55,114
7680,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The 1961 Convention requires a simple majority vote among CND's 53 member states to adopt a WHO (re)scheduling recommendation; the 1971 Convention requires a two-third majority. Any state party can request a substance to be reviewed by the WHO and significant changes in the UN drug control treaty system could thus be adopted without reaching consensus among all the state parties, for example if the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence would recommend to remove cannabis from the treaty schedules (or move it to a lower control category).",544,88,114
7681,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Several substances, in fact, have never been reviewed by the WHO, including cannabis, coca leaf, cocaine, opium and morphine. There was “a common political feeling” at the time that they should be scheduled, but a group of WHO-related experts recently exposed that “we have no proof of a scientific assessment ”. From an evidence-based point of view as well on treaty procedural grounds, the legitimacy of their current classification is therefore questionable.",461,72,114

7684,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties stipulates that a historical “error” and a “fundamental change of circumstances” are valid reasons for a member state to revoke its adherence to a treaty. In light of the ‘ Jurassic' nature of the drug control treaties and the seemingly insurmountable procedural and political obstacles to change them, the question is often raised why countries should not simply ignore or withdraw from the UN drug control treaty regime.",472,77,114
7685,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"States remain party to the treaties for a number of reasons, one of which is that the UN drug control treaties also regulate the global trade in drugs for licit medical purposes, including substances on the WHO list of essential medicines . Adequate access to controlled medicines is already a big problem in most developing countries, and withdrawing from the INCB-administered global system of estimates and requirements operating under the UN drug control conventions would risk making it even worse.",503,80,114
7686,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"Also, being party to all three of the drug control conventions is a condition in a number of preferential trade agreements or for accession to the European Union. Denunciation can therefore have political and economic consequences beyond drug control, especially for less powerful countries.",291,44,114
7688,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The 1969 Vienna Convention also offers an interesting and hitherto little-explored legal option in Article 41: “Two or more parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone”, providing that the modification in question “does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under the treaty or the performance of their obligations” and is not “incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole.”",510,82,114
7689,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"This option could perhaps provide a legal basis for justifying international trade between national jurisdictions that permit or tolerate the existence of a licit market for a particular substance, even though that international trade is not permitted under the UN treaty obligations. It could apply, for example, to the import of hashish from Morocco to supply Spain's cannabis clubs or the coffee shops in the Netherlands. It could also apply to the export of coca leaf from Bolivia – a country where growing and trading in the leaf in its natural form is legal – to countries such as Argentina or Ecuador, where the use of coca leaf is also legal under the country's domestic laws. An agreement between countries like these to modify the treaty and permit trade among themselves would be difficult to challenge with the argument that it affects the rights of other parties.",876,147,114
7690,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"In theory, a group of countries seeking to resolve the dilemma of legal non-compliance with the treaties in the case of cannabis regulation (as is currently the case with Uruguay and the U.S.) could make use of an inter se modification.

7697,635,The UN Drug Control Conventions,terrorism,"The Commentary on the Single Convention (on p. 462-463) mentions an option that seems intriguing in view of the forthcoming UNGASS in 2016: “the General Assembly may itself take the initiative in amending the Convention, either by itself adopting the revisions, or by calling a Plenipotentiary Conference for this purpose.” Thus, the General Assembly could in fact adopt amendments to the treaties by a simple majority vote, “always provided that no amendment, however adopted, would be binding upon a Party not accepting it.”",526,83,114

7951,650,Inside the ransom business – why kidnapping rarely pays,terrorism,"So, the best response to a ransom demand is never to agree immediately to a kidnapper's demands. If the kidnappers have time, they will keep doubling the price and judge the response to this accordingly. If the kidnappers agree to the first ransom offer they are given, they are probably negotiating from the back of a car and are desperate to return the hostage already. If the victim's representatives prevaricate, the case will most likely end with the victim withdrawing whatever cash they can from an ATM once before and once just after midnight: the so called “express kidnap” or “millionaire's ride”.",607,102,14

Milne enrolled in a Spanish-language course in London, and a month later, with rudimentary skills and only one or two solid contacts on the ground, he boarded a flight to Bogotá.

The appeal was simple: in the event of a kidnapping, the insurance would provide reimbursement for ransom payment.",372,66,47
7965,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"There were caveats to prevent fraud and to ensure that the existence of the policy did not actually increase the risk of kidnapping. The first was that the policy had to be kept secret. In fact, it could be voided if its existence became public. The concern was that if the kidnappers knew of the policy, they would demand more money.",334,61,47
7966,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"The second principle is that the policy will only reimburse the ransom once it is paid. The insurance company never fronts any money. In order to raise the cash, the victim's family will probably have to liquidate assets – mortgage the house, sell stocks, pool money from other relatives. This process makes the negotiations credible by dragging them out. This is not just about minimising the payout by the insurance company. Quickly making good on a large ransom raises the expectations of future kidnappers. It can make hostage-taking more lucrative and more common.",569,93,47
7967,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"When K&R insurance first came on the market, the policyholders were left on their own to negotiate with the kidnappers. But in the mid-1970s, an insurance broker named Julian Radcliffe came up with an idea that would revolutionise the industry. Along with a few colleagues, Radcliffe convinced their company to set up a subsidiary focused on hostage response. The subsidiary, which they named Control Risks, would hire security experts – mostly former military and police – to handle negotiations. The cost of hiring the consultant was included in the policy and borne by the insurance company. In 1982, Control Risks became an independent company.",648,104,47

When Milne arrived in Bogotá, he discovered a vast, untapped market. As an insurance broker, he sold a variety of policies offered by different companies available through the Lloyd's exchange in London. The job of the broker is to serve the client and to advocate for their interests in the event of a claim. The underwriters represent the insurance companies.

There was even talk of working through European institutions to impose a ban on K&R insurance throughout the European Union. Recognising that its existence was under threat, the security industry rallied, arguing that since the policies were kept secret, it was clear that people were not being kidnapped because they had insurance. Rather, they were being taken hostage because they had resources – and banning insurance would not change this. Since the policies only provided reimbursement and were always written for amounts less than the net worth of the policyholder, the industry also argued that insurance did not drive up the amount of payment. What's more, the industry pointed out that the availability of K&R insurance helped international businesses to manage risk, which in turn allowed companies – including British and European companies – to operate in dangerous environments while exercising appropriate “duty of care” toward their employees.",1064,165,47

(One consequence was that the families of kidnapped Italian citizens simply stopped reporting the crimes to the authorities.) Meanwhile, Colombia banned ransom payments, then unbanned, then banned them again. Spain operates a very different policy, where its intelligence services are told to bring hostages home at all costs.

7978,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"Through the debates and policy changes, the K&R industry not only survived but thrived. Then came September 11 2001, which changed the terms of the whole discussion. Rather than challenging the K&R industry as a whole, governments increasingly sought to draw a clearer distinction between criminal groups, to whom ransom could legally be paid, and terror groups, to whom it could not. The US and UK governments both maintained lists of Foreign Terrorist Organizations who could not receive ransom payments. In industry parlance, these groups were designated as “proscribed”.",574,89,47
7979,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"This attempt to draw distinctions between criminal and terrorist organisations raised many tricky questions. It was clear that K&R policies could not reimburse policyholders who paid a ransom to a terrorist group. But could security consultants handle negotiations? Could they help families to raise and assemble the funds? And what about the families themselves? Would they be held legally liable for paying ransom to terrorists? “It's all a grey area,” Milne acknowledged.",474,72,47
7980,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"Further complicating the process is the fact that kidnappers often try to hide their identity. Hostage negotiators told me that some terror groups pretend to be criminal organisations so they can collect ransoms. The opposite also occurs. Criminal groups who are ignorant of the legal prohibitions sometimes pretend to be terror organisations in the hopes that the fearsome reputation of these groups will push negotiations along. Under the law, the onus is on the insurance company to demonstrate that kidnappers are “proscribed” in order to invalidate the policy. Negotiators working for the victim's family would sometimes refrain from asking obvious questions about the group holding the hostage. They simply preferred not to know.",735,113,47
7981,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"Meanwhile, decisions about which groups were designated as terrorists were often politically determined and sometimes arbitrary. For example, a 2011 case, Masefield AG v Amlin Corporate Member, determined that the payment of ransom to Somali pirates was legal under British law. As a result, Somali pirates were presumed to be criminals rather than terrorists, even when ties to al-Shabaab militants were alleged. Meanwhile, it was illegal to pay ransom to a criminally oriented kidnapping cell in Nigeria if they were seen to have ties to proscribed groups such as Boko Haram.",577,91,47
7982,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"In effect, the collision of disparate national policies and the insurance market creates complexities that determine who lives and who dies in international kidnapping cases. In 2008, a Canadian journalist, Amanda Lindhout, was kidnapped in Somalia, along with an Australian colleague, Nigel Brennan. As young freelancers, they did not have insurance. Officially, neither Canada nor Australia pay ransom. Driven by desperation, their families found a way forward.",463,67,47
7983,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"The one factor in their favour was that the group that kidnapped the pair was a criminal and not a terror organisation. Because they were not “terrorists,” the Canadian government entered into negotiations, offering to build a school or provide development aid in exchange for Lindhout's release. But the kidnappers wanted cash. They tortured Lindhout to put more pressure on her family, which had few resources. Realising that the negotiations were going nowhere, Lindhout's mother, Lorinda Stewart, decided that the only hope was to pay a ransom. Canadian officials warned Stewart that paying ransom was against the law and that she could be prosecuted for doing so, but she forged ahead.",690,111,47
7984,651,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"Once Stewart made the decision, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which had been handling the case, withdrew all support. The hostage-negotiation team that had been camped in her living room moved out. Stewart, working with the Brennan family in Australia, eventually raised enough money to hire a security consultant from London-based firm AKE to take over the negotiations. The consultant advised the families that negotiations would take several months and they would have to pay a ransom of around $600,000 each. His prediction was spot on. Lindhout and Brennan were freed in November 2009. Their families ended up in massive debt.",636,101,47

On 25 January 2012, US Navy Seals dropped into Somalia and rescued kidnapped US aid worker Jessica Buchanan and her Danish colleague Poul Thisted, shooting dead nine of their kidnappers. Officials had decided to launch a rescue because Buchanan had developed a kidney infection, and they believed her life was in danger.

According to industry data, either a hostage or a rescuer is killed in half of all rescue operations. One tragic example was the 2009 raid carried out by British special forces in Afghanistan that freed kidnapped New York Times reporter Steve Farrell, but led to the death of a British soldier along with two Afghan civilians. Farrell's Afghan colleague, journalist Sultan Munadi, was also killed, possibly shot accidentally by British forces.

On the other hand, his experience caused him to focus on what he sees as the hypocrisy and heartlessness of the government's position.

I don't think the British policy protects people in a way that they claim it does, but they are so entrenched in this idea.

They countered that the French had recently paid $38m for the release of an aid worker, and that an Italian journalist had been ransomed for $15m and the release of several prisoners.

Thus refusing to pay ransom does not appear to reduce the incidence of the crime, but does greatly increase the likelihood that the victim will be killed. Perversely, in the current environment, it may actually increase the money flowing to terrorists, because kidnappers can execute their British and American hostages, who because of the no-concessions policy have little value, as means of putting pressure on the European countries that pay multi-million-dollar ransoms. This is why the problem must be defined differently and more narrowly. How can western countries work together not to stop ransom payments to terrorist kidnappers – which is an unattainable goal – but rather to minimise their size? Clearly, the K&R industry has a key role to play.",898,142,47

Moreover, as Doug Milne notes: “By refusing to allow concessions, you drive the negotiations underground, so the intelligence you might otherwise get following the case disappears. The families feel they could potentially be prosecuted. And the government becomes the enemy.” That's a bad outcome that does not serve the hostage, or advance Britain's national security.

8013,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"In Argentina in the early 1970s, leftist guerrillas started snatching executives of multinational companies and demanding ransoms. This culminated in the payment of $60 million to the Montoneros, a Peronist guerrilla group, for the release of the brothers Juan and Jorge Born, executives at the grain-exporting firm Bunge & Born and the sons of its president. The ransom seems noteworthy for its heft—at about $275 million in today's money, it stands as the largest one paid in a conventional kidnapping case. (In 2017 Qatar reportedly paid $1 billion to an al-Qaeda affiliate and Iran to win the release of a royal hunting party.) But perhaps what makes the Born case more unusual in the history of the ransom trade is the fact that Jorge himself negotiated the price while captive. He had intimate knowledge of the company's finances and thus had a precise sense of how much money could be raised—though not, crucially, how much ought to be paid. The deal he struck was delivered to Born père, who had refused the initial demand of $100 million, as a signed memorandum.",1071,181,30
8014,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"As Argentine ransoms soared, insurers at Lloyd's of London were beginning to rake in premiums from a peculiar product. Kidnap-and-ransom ( K&R ) insurance had existed since 1932—it was developed in response to the abduction and killing of Charles Lindbergh's twenty-month-old son—but it didn't take off until the 1960s, following a series of kidnappings of businessmen and their families in Europe and Latin America. Companies started buying coverage for those employees most likely to be targeted, and the market boomed. Had Bunge & Born purchased coverage for the brothers, it would have been reimbursed for at least a portion of the payout.",643,102,30
8015,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"But early K&R insurance had a notable flaw: insurers were not involved in the ransoming process. Families and employers were left to haggle with kidnappers, raise funds, and deliver payments; insurers simply paid them back. Of course, these distressed and inexperienced parties were “not in a position to strike the best deal,” writes Joel Simon in We Want to Negotiate: The Secret World of Kidnapping, Hostages, and Ransom, which includes a concise survey of the K&R industry. And parties who paid too much might be targeted again: in 1983 the wife of Teddy Wang, a Hong Kong property tycoon, paid $11 million for his return; in 1990 she paid $60 million—but that time he was not released, and his body was never found.",720,123,30
8016,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"In the mid-1970s, Julian Radcliffe, a young insurance broker in London, helped fix this flaw. He came up with the idea for Control Risks, a security consultancy that, as part of the Lloyd's K&R package, would advise policyholders on how to prevent kidnappings and assist if one occurred. Potential insured parties would be thoroughly vetted, and those who passed muster would be rewarded for the implementation of specific security measures (such as hiring guards or varying routes to work) with reduced premiums—a way of mitigating the classic problems of “adverse selection” (the tendency of those likely to experience a loss to seek coverage) and “moral hazard” (the lack of incentive to avoid risk where there is protection against its consequences).",754,120,30

8019,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"The K&R business has been imagined to involve high drama and heroism. A 1998 Vanity Fair article described it as “a world in which Cold War exiles—a roguish business of small companies and locked doors and names such as Control Risks—will send ex-spooks, special forces, or Scotland Yard men anywhere on earth, on a moment's notice, to bail you out when the kidnappers are demanding millions.” Hollywood for a time was keen on K&R . In the 2000 film Proof of Life, Terry Thorne, a former SAS officer (played by Russell Crowe at peak brawn), is dispatched to “Tecala,” a fictional South American country, to negotiate with a rebel group for the release of an American petroleum engineer. It's soon discovered that the engineer's employer failed to renew its K&R policy, and Thorne is summoned back to London. But he returns and offers his services pro bono, lest the engineer's beautiful wife (Meg Ryan) receive inferior assistance from some compromised local go-between. Thorne wrestles the ransom down from $6 million to $650,000, but the negotiation falls through for other reasons, so Thorne teams up with another kidnap specialist whose client, an insured Italian businessman, is being held in the same rebel camp.

8021,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"Naturally, an action movie can't end with an orderly commercial resolution, though that's exactly how the case that inspired Proof of Life did: Thomas Hargrove, a scientist captured by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) in 1994 and held for eleven months, was released after his family, without the assistance of a negotiator, made two payments totaling $250,000. Around 90 percent of all kidnappings are successfully resolved, meaning the hostages return alive, usually through ransom—an “astonishing success rate,” remarks Anja Shortland in Kidnap: Inside the Ransom Business. And the odds are considerably better if specialists are involved: more than 97 percent of cases handled by professional negotiators are resolved successfully, almost always through ransom. (A small percentage of hostages escape and an even smaller number are rescued.) In almost all of these cases, the negotiators are provided as part of an insurance package, but if a victim is uninsured, they can be hired directly (the good ones for over $2,000 a day).",1052,165,30
8022,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"“How can such a difficult market operate so successfully?,” Shortland asks. As she might have done more to emphasize, K&R insurance is for the wealthy or well-connected international and national elite: rich local families, employees of major corporations, staff journalists, and NGO workers. But worldwide, most victims are kidnapped in their own countries, and few will be covered. Foreigners are an extreme minority of kidnap victims, between 2 and 6 percent, depending on the region.",487,75,30
8023,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"Accordingly, insured payouts constitute a small percentage of the roughly $500 million to $1.5 billion collected in ransoms each year, but Shortland argues that the growing use of insurance has made kidnapping both safer and more affordable for all victims. This is because the industry's professionals practice what Shortland calls “ransom discipline”: they know the going rates in local markets and help their clients pay no more than is necessary, which stabilizes the market overall. Simon notes that “negotiators can now predict with a good degree of accuracy how long a case will take to resolve and how much ransom will be paid based on the location of the incident and the nationality of the victim.” With its record of success, the industry is flourishing. More than 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies have K&R policies, and premiums are worth $250 to $300 million a year.",882,146,30
8024,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"It's striking that both Shortland, an economist at King's College London and an expert on Somali piracy who examines the kidnapping market through a “rational choice framework” (and admits to having been reminded by one source that “people die, Anja!”), and Simon, who as the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists is concerned above all with safety, believe that the industry is a net positive. Critics have long worried that, as Simon puts it, the “tendency to look for monetary settlements fuels global kidnapping.” By facilitating ransom payments, this logic goes, insurance helps make kidnapping profitable and thereby encourages further crime. And the insured are particularly vulnerable, as kidnappers might target people suspected of having coverage.",778,118,30
8025,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"Such arguments first gained traction in 1986, when Jennifer Guinness, the wife of John Guinness, a banker and member of the brewing family, was kidnapped by the Provisional IRA , which demanded $2.6 million. She was rescued by the Gardaí days later, but a K&R policy had been triggered and Control Risks retained to negotiate. Authorities reported that the kidnappers expected that the money “would come from an insurance policy.” Public outrage led one English MP to call for the prosecution of Control Risks and its underwriter for violating prevention-of-terrorism laws. Parliament passed a motion expressing concern, and there was talk of a Europe-wide ban on K&R coverage.",677,108,30
8026,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"The industry defended itself on various grounds in a trade publication. It was rare for the insured to be kidnapped at all. Policies were conditional on absolute secrecy (if the buyer was an employer, insured employees were forbidden from being told they were covered), so victims were being taken hostage not because they were known to have insurance but because they were known to be rich or prominent. Policy requirements led to heightened safety, which by definition lowered risks. Moreover, insurance did not drive up ransoms, as the policies only provided reimbursement and were written for less than the policyholder's net worth. The K&R industry was not only not fueling kidnapping, its advocates maintained, it was serving the greater good: the availability of coverage enabled international companies to operate in dangerous environments while fulfilling their “duty of care” toward their employees.",909,141,30
8028,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"Eventually, it was determined that Control Risks and its underwriter had broken no laws, and the outrage faded. In other parts of Europe and in Latin America, however, laws designed to inhibit the hostage trade were enacted. Italy had been an abduction hotspot since the late 1960s—John Paul Getty III was kidnapped in Rome in 1973—and in 1991 the government criminalized the sale of K&R insurance and the negotiation and payment of ransom, and made it possible to preemptively freeze assets of the victim's family or employer. Victims stopped reporting incidents to the authorities and arranged to pay ransoms outside the country. Inspired by Italy, Colombia introduced anti-kidnapping legislation in 1993, and there too negotiations went underground.",752,117,30

Indeed, groups engaged in kidnapping had gotten both bolder and more sophisticated. In Colombia in the 1990s, the FARC collected detailed financial data on the firms operating locally and maintained a database of potential targets, which they would check on laptops as they evaluated parties at roadblocks. Even the US, which, owing largely to the efficacy of law enforcement, has historically had a low kidnapping rate, saw a surge in robbery-style incidents during this time. There were “doorbell abductions,” in which the family of a banker would be held at home while the banker was taken to the bank to get money (the model for the 2001 film Bandits). In Silicon Valley, executives of tech companies were ambushed on the way home from work and forced at gunpoint back to the office to hand over valuable computer components.",1225,200,30
8031,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"As these changes and innovations suggest, kidnapping for ransom (usually money but occasionally goods—according to Auerbach, an American businessman was once exchanged for two basketballs and two teams' worth of uniforms) is almost always a deliberative enterprise. “Kidnappers make rational choices,” Shortland writes. Like the professionals on the other side, kidnappers perform research, assess risks, manage costs, and, if they're in it for the long term, build reputations for orderly resolution. Some groups even develop an infrastructure to support their operations, though this is expensive and may increase the number of expectant beneficiaries (if operations are mounted on credit, for example).",705,101,30
8032,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"When kidnappers keep hostages for days, weeks, or months, most invest in keeping them alive (a corpse is not worth much, except in the Iliad) and in decent health. Captives with medical conditions are usually allowed to receive medications; in 2010 al-Qaeda let a French woman with breast cancer take chemo drugs. Somali pirates are governed by a strict code of conduct that fines guards for hurting hostages; there's even a printed “Pirate's Handbook.” They have been known to send their counterparties receipts for items, such as bottled water, procured for the proper maintenance of the captives. Criminal groups want to be seen as trustworthy adversaries bargaining in good faith—if the ransom is paid, the hostage is released—and know that killing or harming hostages will imperil negotiations and, in some cases, lead to armed intervention.",846,135,30
8033,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"Even though kidnappers are rational actors (in theory, at least) and outcomes are generally predictable, “there are no shortcuts” to resolution, Shortland observes. “Why don't we just pay them a million?” the director of an oil firm asked a crisis responder. “We spill more than that in a day.” As with any transaction that involves haggling, there's an unavoidable theatricality and ceremony to the process, and professional negotiators are accustomed to this—“There is a pace, a rhythm to these things,” one consultant told Shortland. If the initial demand is $1 million, and recent cases in the area have been settled for around $10,000 in around five days, then “an initial offer of $5,000 might be a good start” and “more money will be ‘found'—though in decreasing increments,” petering out around $10,000. But if precedents are around $100,000, “a paltry initial offer of $5,000 could be perceived as an insult and put the hostage's life at risk.”",953,156,30
8034,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"With their second and third rounds of offers, negotiators on both sides signal the “curve” and likely convergence point, which in most cases, according to Simon, will be between 5 and 10 percent of the opening ask. And although kidnappers tend to release hostages when they believe that the cost of holding out exceeds the benefit, they will sometimes test this with silence, threats, or abuse—this is called “wringing the towel dry.” Families have to dissemble, claiming there's simply nothing left. If an ear or finger arrives in the mail, it's worth doing a DNA test.",570,96,30
8035,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"The course of a negotiation can also be affected by external factors, such as media exposure. Shortland recounts the 2011 abduction by Somali pirates of the crew of the Danish-owned merchant ship Leopard. The pirates demanded $10 million for the crew, and the company that owned the ship claimed it was on the brink of bankruptcy. The pirates went down to $6 million. But then a Danish tabloid and TV channel revealed that the shipowner was a multimillionaire who was living large while his crew suffered. The pirates immediately increased their demand to $15 million, and as public anger in Denmark grew against the “callous” owner, the pirates leaped to $35 million. The case was finally resolved, after 839 days, for $6.9 million, raised from several sources. The hostages sued the media outlets for worsening their ordeal. And Somali pirates' appetites were whetted.",870,143,30
8036,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"But the biggest risk to the stability of the hostage trade, in both Shortland's and Simon's accounts, is the apparently well-meaning terrorism policies of sovereign governments. “The terror attacks” of September 11, writes Simon, “and the wave of high profile kidnappings carried out by Al Qaeda-aligned groups, spawned a coordinated, global effort to deprive terror groups of financing.” Governments now “sought to draw a clearer distinction between criminal groups, to whom ransom could legally be paid, and terror groups, to whom it could not.” The UN forbids the transfer of money to designated terrorist groups; the US Treasury, the EU, and other governmental bodies also maintain such lists. Private persons and entities cannot legally make concessions to proscribed groups, and if they do, their insurers cannot legally reimburse them, though ransom-payers are rarely if ever prosecuted.",894,136,30
8037,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"“If it's criminal, it's legal,” a British bureaucrat told Shortland of ransom payments. But it's not always clear which category kidnappers fit into. Some terrorists pretend to be part of criminal organizations so that they can legally collect ransoms. Shortland reports that when a Somali told British negotiators that he represented the “commercial arm” of al-Shabaab, the jihadist fundamentalist group, “they had to explain that this was not sufficiently removed from the parent organization to have a payment authorized.” Some criminals, apparently ignorant of the rules, pretend to be terrorists in order to intimidate their counterparties. Negotiators may take care to avoid learning whether the hostage-takers are proscribed. Jere van Dyk, an American journalist who was kidnapped in 2008 in a Pashtun tribal area on the Afghanistan–Pakistan border, was told by a specialist in the region that his captors were part of a criminal group who put on an elaborate, protracted act, pretending to be the Taliban for Van Dyk's sole benefit. With this somewhat strained deniability, Shortland notes, “his employers could pursue a private resolution through their insurance company.”",1181,180,30
8038,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"Governments sometimes do make concessions to terrorists, further complicating matters. It is an open secret that, in defiance of the UN ransom ban, European and Asian states have paid to free journalists, aid workers, and others. When states negotiate, they will almost certainly overpay: even a wealthy family can plausibly plead financial limits, but Spain cannot claim to have little cash on hand. This kind of inflation inevitably spreads to the criminal market, in which governments rarely intervene. “If a European government pays millions of dollars in ransom to release a hostage held by a terrorist group,” Simon writes, “then a criminal group that kidnaps a hapless tourist will expect a similar payout from a family of modest means that may not have insurance or the help of a security consultant.” In Shortland's view, the main threat to the stability of the hostage trade is a lack of ransom discipline, and governments are among the worst offenders.",963,157,30
8039,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"The private sector has indeed developed an effective regime for governing the international criminal kidnapping market. The network of insurers and crisis responders is a small, tight-knit community whose members share information freely yet discreetly (the underwriters in the Lloyd's syndicates sit feet from one another in an office on Lime Street), subscribe to common protocols, reward top performance, and shun those who mess up. (Civil servants, unlike private negotiators, are not likely to lose their jobs if they fail to contain costs.) Shortland believes that this private governance regime is “the best (if not the only) way of ordering this difficult market.”",672,103,30
8040,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"But even though K&R premiums have fallen by half in the past decade, not everyone who could benefit from coverage has it, and not every family can afford à la carte services. Freelance journalists and volunteer aid workers are particularly vulnerable. Shortland suggests in passing that security firms ought to increase their pro bono work; Simon goes further, proposing that governments work with the industry “to develop innovative ways to extend coverage to vulnerable groups,” and that families lacking insurance be given access to consultants in extraordinary circumstances, whether through pro bono services or through a government subsidy.",646,98,30
8041,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"These are sensible proposals. But any analysis of the K&R business is limited to a small fraction of all kidnapping incidents. Even if the effects of this system are felt more widely, they are felt most directly among those who are similar to insured parties. Most victims continue to be low-risk, low-value locals. Shortland observes that in areas with informal protectors, such as entrenched rebel and mafia groups, kidnapping has most commonly been used to “tax” families and companies who fail to make appropriate protection payments. But kidnap practices—both who does it and how—are changing. The one-off model of hostage-taking, long used with foreigners and wealthy nationals, is increasingly seen in local kidnappings unrelated to protection—though this is still essentially self-regulating in its efficiency and modest goals.",835,127,30
8042,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"In Mexico, kidnappers used to target the ultrarich, but many have shifted focus to the middle class. The trade has been “democratized,” a Mexican crisis responder told The Economist. Social media have created a new way to shop for victims who are not tabloid princesses and scions of industrial families but who look flush and might be handily location-tagged on Instagram or lured on Tinder. Kidnappers who lack resources or skills, or who simply want to make a quick buck, may avoid the challenges of hostage-keeping altogether. In countries such as Brazil, Ecuador, and Tanzania, the norm has become the “express” kidnapping: victims are taken to an ATM , forced to withdraw the daily maximum (twice, if the detention straddles midnight), and released. Some kidnappers don't even bother with the kidnapping. In a “virtual” or “phantom” case, the criminals send a ransom demand while the unwitting “hostage” is in the cinema or on a hike (and thus cannot be contacted), or else they call and threaten the victim, telling him not to talk to anyone for a given period of time, during which they extort his family.",1113,187,30
8043,652,Kidnapping: A Very Efficient Business,terrorism,"The history of modern kidnapping-for-ransom is dominated by cases involving high-profile victims; those of lesser standing are always likely to be overlooked. In 1932, the same year the Lindbergh baby was abducted, a nineteen-year-old, well-to-do English woman named Muriel “Tinko” Pawley was taken hostage, along with her three dogs, by bandits in northern China. Tinko had grown up mostly in China and married an Englishman who worked for the Asiatic Petroleum Company. The kidnappers demanded a huge sum of money and sundry supplies, and threatened that failure to comply would result in Tinko's ears being cut off and her dogs killed.",638,101,30

Evelyn Waugh even wrote a short story based on it. But Tinko's case was part of a vastly larger trend that affected many Westerners of modest means. In the preceding ten years, missionary families, salesmen, carriages of train passengers, and entire steamships had been captured, and those whose families were slow in paying did have their ears sliced off. When one of those trains was held up in Lincheng in 1923, two dozen foreigners were captured, and their safety became an international concern.

They struggle to pay ransoms quickly because of their relative poverty, and victims are much more likely to be killed. The report also presents a valuable attempt to quantify the costs of kidnapping and to map its spread. Between 2011 and 2020, it concludes that over $18 million had been paid in ransom. The amount of ransom accelerated in the latter portion of that period: between 2016 and 2020, around $11 million was paid out.

Recognising that its existence was under threat, the security industry rallied, arguing that since the policies were kept secret, it was clear that people were not being kidnapped because they had insurance. Rather, they were being taken hostage because they had resources – and banning insurance would not change this. Since the policies only provided reimbursement and were always written for amounts less than the net worth of the policyholder, the industry also argued that insurance did not drive up the amount of payment. What's more, the industry pointed out that the availability of K&R insurance helped international businesses to manage risk, which in turn allowed companies – including British and European companies – to operate in dangerous environments while exercising appropriate “duty of care” toward their employees.",1064,165,47

Meanwhile, Colombia banned ransom payments, then unbanned, then banned them again.

Then came September 11 2001, which changed the terms of the whole discussion. Rather than challenging the K&R industry as a whole, governments increasingly sought to draw a clearer distinction between criminal groups, to whom ransom could legally be paid, and terror groups, to whom it could not. The US and UK governments both maintained lists of Foreign Terrorist Organizations who could not receive ransom payments. In industry parlance, these groups were designated as “proscribed”.",574,89,47
8159,659,The business of kidnapping: inside the secret world of hostage negotiation,terrorism,"This attempt to draw distinctions between criminal and terrorist organisations raised many tricky questions. It was clear that K&R policies could not reimburse policyholders who paid a ransom to a terrorist group. But could security consultants handle negotiations?

Hostage negotiators told me that some terror groups pretend to be criminal organisations so they can collect ransoms. The opposite also occurs. Criminal groups who are ignorant of the legal prohibitions sometimes pretend to be terror organisations in the hopes that the fearsome reputation of these groups will push negotiations along. Under the law, the onus is on the insurance company to demonstrate that kidnappers are “proscribed” in order to invalidate the policy.

This is why the problem must be defined differently and more narrowly.

Eastern Ukraine, Wagner's other primary area of operations, has likewise long since settled into a stable front line punctuated by occasional shootouts and shelling.

The U.S. State Department website also lists Wagner as an entity connected to the “Defense Sector of the Government of the Russian Federation.” Any business relationship between Prince and Wagner would, in effect, make the influential Trump administration adviser a subcontractor to the Russian military. In recent years, the Russian government has deployed Wagner to several African countries, Ukraine, and Syria, where the U.S. military killed dozens of Wagner fighters in 2018 after the Russians and their Syrian allies attacked an oil facility that the United States was defending. “Wagner Group is an instrument of Russian policy.

In 2017, the Trump administration sanctioned Wagner, as well as its founder and head Dmitry Utkin, for having “recruited and sent soldiers to fight alongside [Russian-backed] separatists in eastern Ukraine” during the 2014 Russian invasion. The Russian government denied involvement in the invasion, even as its forces occupied and took control of Crimea, also in Ukrainian territory, in violation of international law. The sanctions prohibit individuals or companies from providing “financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.” They also forbid anyone “to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf” of Wagner. The 2017 addition of Wagner to the sanctions list builds on a 2014 executive order signed by President Barack Obama. “In my experience, the act of soliciting from a sanctioned party would indeed be an apparent violation,” said Brian O'Toole, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council and former senior sanctions official at the Treasury Department. “Whether you make that [legal] case is an entirely separate matter,” he said, adding that pitching business to Wagner “would seem to be a fairly egregious thing to do.”",1370,217,5

A former Navy SEAL who rose to prominence and notoriety as head of the private security firm Blackwater, Prince has been a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, serving as an unofficial adviser on military and foreign policy issues in Africa, the Middle East, and Afghanistan. Prince was a Trump donor in 2016 and has worked to support the president politically while proposing private military solutions that would benefit his companies financially. Early in the Trump administration, Prince proposed privatizing the war in Afghanistan and supplying Trump with a private spy service intended to circumvent the U.S. intelligence community. Neither proposal succeeded, despite having support for some of his ideas from senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. For years, Prince has tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to win military contracts with governments in Africa and the Middle East.

The pressure suit provided to each pilot was affectionately referred to as “the Bag.” Designed to keep its occupant's blood from boiling in the thin atmosphere at high altitude, the multi-layered suits were tailor-made. Each pilot was also fitted with an 11-pound, astronaut-style helmet that attached to the pressure suit by a metal ring and was spring-mounted to reduce shoulder fatigue. One would-be A-12 pilot, Collins remembers, was so claustrophobic under the helmet that he washed out of the program.",710,110,38

Pilots and support personnel simply referred to the facility as “the Area.” They began arriving there in late 1962. Only then were they introduced to the A-12. Collins remembers walking into a darkened hangar as sun rays canted down from the upper windows and being stunned by the sight of the jet. “Its sleek length, the massive twin rudders, and its total blackness,” says Collins. “A vision that will never be forgotten.”",567,98,38

To anyone who asked, the pilots and their Air Force-turned-CIA support staff worked as civilian consultants for Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City, California. Their cover story came replete with a Hughes employee ID and business cards. Printed on the cards was a telephone number to a Hughes secretary, who would politely inform callers that the party they were trying to reach was out of the office and ask them to leave a message.

Advancing the throttles seemed to have no effect. Suddenly, the nose pitched up and the jet stalled, entering an inverted flat spin. Collins slammed his helmet visor shut, grabbed the D-ring between his legs, pushed his head back against the seat, and punched out.

Within two hours, a four-engine Lockheed Constellation loaded with security personnel arrived to secure the crash site. Landing soon after the Connie was Kelly Johnson's personal jet, which flew Collins to the Lovelace Clinic in New Mexico for a medical evaluation. Weeks later, he says, the CIA attempted to hypnotize him, to glean every subconscious detail about the crash that might have been lost from memory as he ejected.

Then it was wheels up and off to get gas.

Amid the discussions on that case and on insider trading generally, the role of technology in communicating information has often been overlooked. Social media networks and advancements in mobile technologies are now critical conduits not just of information but also important drivers of human behavior. Technological developments in how we access and communicate information will continue to factor heavily in the commission of insider trading as well as the enforcement challenges and opportunities, say David N.

9548,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,Technology has impacted more than the brick-sized mobile phone that Hollywood gave Michael Douglas's character Gordon Gekko in the original Wall Street movie (1987) to facilitate his covert receipt of material nonpublic information. Technological innovations and growing social-media networks are now critical conduits of information and also important drivers of human behavior. They will factor heavily in the efforts that regulators make in the future to enforce insider trading laws.,487,70,28
9549,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"Insider trading has always been the white-collar crime that creates headlines and grabs public attention (as it has done for several months in the Galleon case). The schemes and artifices are often Shakespearian in quality, revealing the nature of our temptations and the manifestations of our flaws. The subplots have involved abuse of trust, misuse of power, greed, corruption, bribery, theft, conspiracy, arrogance, stealth, deception, threats, the allure of drugs and sex, attempted cover-ups and obstruction of justice. Investigative techniques were immutably established long ago — subpoenas, search warrants, physical and electronic surveillance, witnesses, informants, cooperators, confessions and plea bargains.",720,100,28
9550,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"The secretive nature of this crime mandates that detection is rarely contemporaneous with its commission. Trials are thus historical prisms through which longstanding activity is viewed and judged. Because even the most efficient enforcement efforts cannot catch all violations and violators, successful outcomes must deliver a highly-publicized message of general deterrence: “No one is above the law.”",403,57,28
9551,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"What exactly is illegal insider trading? The person on the street would likely state they “know it when they see it.” As a matter of law and regulatory application, however, insider trading is far more complicated. Illegal insider trading occurs when a person uses material non-public information to trade securities of a publicly-held company, and where the insider obtains a personal benefit in exchange for breaching a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence. The people trading on inside information are divided into two camps — the “tippers” and the “tippees.” A “tipper” is the individual who communicates material nonpublic information about a public company. A “tippee” is the individual who receives and trades, or passes on, this material nonpublic information. The “tippee” is liable if aware of the breach of duty or confidence by his “tipper.”",877,139,28
9552,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"The reality surrounding the enforcement of laws and regulations involving insider trading is complex. Individuals and businesses typically desire precision in the rules and regulations that govern their conduct. In contrast, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) understandably prefer the other side of the trade — that the parameters of illegal conduct remain sufficiently flexible so that enforcement decisions can be made with the broadest possible discretion.",506,73,28
9553,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"As a result, the precise conduct under the definition of insider trading has always been vague, and purposely so — ambiguous enough to allow enforcement efforts to adapt over time to changed circumstances and to the human instinct to innovate for personal advantage. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt explained this time-honored enforcement approach in a March 2011 interview with Bloomberg News: “If the SEC had an option as to whether they wanted to have greater specificity and the Justice Department as well, they'd say ‘Absolutely not' because greater specificity would give the legal fraternity various ways of getting around those specifics. They want these laws purposely vague to see to it they have the maximum leverage in terms of bringing cases.”",758,121,28
9554,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"The ambiguity around insider trading continues to raise questions. Currently open for public review and debate is the question of whether it is legal for a corporate officer of a company to privately buy stock in a target corporation before making a recommendation that potentially leads to the target's acquisition. This was the critical factor involved in the controversy involving David Sokol, who was widely reputed to be Warren Buffett's successor at Berkshire Hathaway. Sokol reportedly invested in the stock of Lubrizol just before recommending that Berkshire Hathaway purchase the company.",597,91,28
9555,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"While the parameters of insider trading may remain vague, the underlying rationales for its prohibition have been consistent and clear. Securities exchanges are the marketing platforms for attracting investment capital and creating liquidity needed to support innovation and economic expansion. Insider trading undermines investor confidence in the integrity and fairness of how investment risk and reward are allocated. As a matter of fundamental fairness to individual investors and fiduciary institutions entrusted with hard-earned savings and retirement funds, the disadvantage that flows from being at the short end of insider information resonates legally as fraud and theft — and, intuitively, as just plain wrong.",721,103,28
9556,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"Information is power, and that power is controlled by a limited number of insiders. Material information is in relatively short and prized supply. Global stock markets are the open-source trading networks for monetizing knowledge and power that has not been fully shared. Unlike boilerplate warnings for investments in mutual funds, the past charts on the performance of material nonpublic information are highly predictive of the potential and allure for future yields and returns. The motivations also have remained the same over time. They extend beyond financial rewards, and include a wide range of commercial and personal “relationship currencies.” Whether as a matter of empirical proof or human instinct, the risk-reward equation for insider trading always has appeared to — and may, in fact — favor the risk.",817,127,28
9557,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"Insider trading is an equal opportunity employer — recruiting without regard to age, race, religion, background, sexual orientation, educational background, occupation, social-standing, or monetary need.

9558,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"Recent events confirm these themes. The news of the day is replete with insider trading cases.

9559,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"The trial dynamics also are being repeated in recent insider trading cases. Once again, the government takes its witnesses as it finds them. Former co-conspirators, now testifying as government witnesses, remain susceptible to cross examinations based on their motives to cooperate in exchange for reduced jail time, faulty recollections, and inconsistent statements. Third-party witnesses attest to the nonpublic and confidential nature of certain information and their duty not to disclose. The most compelling and incriminating proof comes in the form of the defendant's own express and implied admissions — words, voice, hand and keystroke. Evidence emanates from a vast array of sources, including electronic recordings of meetings and telephone calls, records of trading activity, emails, text messages, offshore bank accounts and digital fingerprints left behind when systems and sites are accessed.",906,131,28

It goes back [before] the days of Ivan Boesky and bags of cash. People are what people are and in an environment where money is the currency that fuels the system, there's going to be insider trading … There always will be insider trading and a lot more that hasn't come out, and never will come out. And I think the best the regulators can do is to find some of the most egregious cases involving some of the most prestigious people which gives us something of a lesson about human nature, where there are massive sums of money, where there are questions of power …",626,115,28

9563,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"Nothing has changed about the motivations underlying insider trading. Technological advances, however, signal new conspiratorial horizons for insider trading, as well as challenges and opportunities for enforcement officials. The means by which we connect, communicate, coordinate, organize, associate, and disseminate is evolving in radical and unpredictably entrepreneurial trajectories. The impact has been profound in influencing commercial activity, consumer behavior, reporting of current events, leaking of governmental and corporate secrets, our social and intimate relationships, religious beliefs and even populist regime change. These are becoming embedded and reflected in the commission of our crimes.",714,93,28
9564,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"What has changed insider trading is both access to material nonpublic information, the connectivity of individuals who are in position to pass along and act upon it, and the multitude of technological platforms for sending and receiving information. Once, the communication of insider information was confined to a direct meeting or a conversation over a landline. Stealth activity was essentially limited to the use of a pay phone, speaking on a third-party's land-line, maintaining an off-shore bank account, and employing covert and euphemistic language. In 1987, Martin Siegel, former investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert, when discussing inside information with a co-conspirator about the then-rumored takeover of Beatrice Foods, coined the infamous phrase: “Your Bunny has a good nose.”",799,119,28
9565,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"First, the vast and interlocking webs of alleged illegality reveal the greater ability of tippers and tippees to connect with each other. Media reports graphically show a “web” of overlapping interconnections. Unlike the relatively simpler and smaller groups of individuals implicated in the Michael Milken or Ivan Boesky insider trading cases, the web of connections in the Galleon-related cases is overwhelming. It may be that personal networks are larger today than 25 years ago, because of the Internet. Or, perhaps it was more difficult previously for the government to prove the connections between others because more conversations occurred in person, not everyone used a cellular telephone, and ‘social media' was only a gleam in Gordon Gekko's eye. Either way, although the concept of an ‘expert network' may have loosely existed, it was not an established business model. This paradigm of web-based access to networks of individuals with information, with identities often purposely cloaked, was simply not available in Milken's era.",1043,160,28
9567,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"To effectively understand and pursue insider trading, enforcement officials now have to go far beyond traditional investigative techniques and analyses. The Rajaratnam trial — whose “guilty” verdict has just been delivered on May 11 — and other current cases involving ‘expert networks' are informative about the future of insider trading and law enforcement. These cases demonstrate how the evolution of technology and connectivity require law enforcement to enlist new twists on investigative techniques. Apart from some notable prosecutions of brokerage “boiler rooms” for stock manipulation in the 1990s, wiretaps were seldom used in white-collar cases. The wiretaps in Galleon and related cases have been critical in convincing various subjects to cooperate with investigations and testify, and provide insights into the network of relationships and communication channels. These results would have been difficult without the overwhelming persuasiveness of the recordings with electronic surveillance.",1006,142,28
9568,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"Government investigators are adopting other tools, too. The SEC last year unveiled a new Market Abuse Unit which aims to identify large-scale insider trading networks and rings. The unit aims “to be proactive by identifying patterns, connections and relationships among traders and institutions at the outset of investigations,” rather than waiting for tips from informants or referrals from stock exchanges about unusual trading. The government is also monitoring activities involving social media sites to determine whether criminals are perpetrating old crimes in new ways. The SEC last year obtained an emergency asset freeze against individuals alleged to be fraudulently touting penny stocks through Facebook and Twitter. The SEC says the individuals received millions of shares of the touted companies as compensation and then sold the shares on the open market while simultaneously using social media to predict massive price increases for the issuers.",960,143,28

9570,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"Foreign governments too are cracking down on insider trading with more vigor. In December 2010, the European Commission suggested mandatory prison terms for insider trading, and Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission sought to ban a defendant in an insider trading case from futures trading there. In January 2011, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that it is making a concerted effort to fight insider trading, and in July that year, Russia passed its first comprehensive insider trading law. Similarly, recent prosecutions in France and Brazil (which culminated in the first criminal convictions for insider trading in that country) have highlighted that insider trading enforcement has indeed gone global.",734,109,28
9571,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"Yet another point illustrated by the Galleon trial concerns the inherent tensions that arise when information becomes more available and accessible. Efforts to police the markets are challenged by these same advances in technology, as well as competing privacy concerns. A central argument the defense offered in its opening statement in the Rajaratnam case was that the defendant was simply trading on a mosaic of public information and thus was not committing insider trading. Here, the proliferation of information accessible through social media provides a challenge to prosecutors. A defendant can put forth expert testimony that all trades were based on information circulated on a blog or website that was accessible to all investors.",741,114,28
9572,730,Insider Trading 2011: How Technology and Social Networks Have ‘Friended' Access to Confidential Information,financialCrime,"Social media sites can provide important data to investigators as well. For example, the government can subpoena Twitter for who “tweeted” classified or other illegally-obtained information. Or it can review Facebook and LinkedIn-type profiles to establish relationships among co-conspirators. Nevertheless, some attempts by the government to mine social media sites for information have raised privacy concerns. For example, its attempt to force Twitter to turn over “customer or subscriber account information for each account registered to or associated with Wikileaks” prompted the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation to challenge the government's rights without a search warrant. The government won that battle, at least for now. In March 2011, a federal magistrate judge re-affirmed a prior order requiring Twitter to produce the subpoenaed information about Wikileaks to the government. Presumably a government subpoena demanding to know the identities of who “tweeted” material nonpublic information or market rumors would likewise be permitted.",1087,154,28

10248,759,Spotting Creative Accounting on the Balance Sheet,Fraud,"Overall, creative accounting can come in many different forms. It can also occur in many different ways. Keep in mind that certain loopholes do exist that may help a company positively spin financial reporting in their favor legally. On the balance sheet, spotting creative accounting practices can be broken down into three categories for analysis: assets, liabilities, and equity. The balance sheet is closely tied to the income statement which is often where issues with asset revenue and/or liability expenses can help to create inflated revenues or understated expenses that result in a higher bottom line net income and furthermore a higher level of retained earnings tied back to the balance sheet. Here we'll explore some of the ways each of the three categories of the balance sheet can be manipulated. However, keep in mind that any scenario involving the illegal overstatement of assets, understatement of liabilities, or overall under or overstatement of shareholders' equity can reap short term benefits but when spotted will have negative consequences.

10255,759,Spotting Creative Accounting on the Balance Sheet,Fraud,"Companies that manipulate their balance sheet are often seeking to increase their net income earnings power in order to create the appearance of a stronger financial condition or stronger management performance. After all, financially sound companies can more easily obtain lines of credit at low interest rates, as well as more easily issue debt financing or issue bonds on better terms. Companies may also be looking to overstate their overall asset position to potential creditors.",484,75,27
10257,759,Spotting Creative Accounting on the Balance Sheet,Fraud,"Assets top out balance sheet construction. Like liabilities, assets are divided into current (12 months or less) and long-term (more than 12 months). Items commonly found in the asset category include: cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and intellectual intangibles.",285,40,27
10259,759,Spotting Creative Accounting on the Balance Sheet,Fraud,"Accounts receivable have a direct link to revenues on the income statement. Companies that use accrual accounting can book revenue in accounts receivable as soon as a sale is made. Thus, the processing of accounts receivable can be one high risk area for premature or fabricated revenues.",288,47,27
10260,759,Spotting Creative Accounting on the Balance Sheet,Fraud,"One reason accounts receivables may be overstated can be inappropriate planning for doubtful accounts. Prudent companies typically take proactive measures for account receivable defaults. By not doing so, this can inflate earnings. It is up to each company to analyze and estimate the percentage of accounts receivables that goes uncollected on a regular basis. If there is no allowance for doubtful accounts, accounts receivable will receive a temporary boost in the short term. Investors can possibly detect when the reserves for doubtful accounts are inadequate. Accounts receivable will not be fully turned into cash, which can show up in liquidity ratios like the quick ratio. Write-downs will also need to be made to revenues. If accounts receivable makes up a substantial portion of assets and inadequate default procedures are in place this can be a problem. Without doubtful account planning, revenue growth will be overstated in the short-term but potentially retracted over the longer term.",1001,155,27
10262,759,Spotting Creative Accounting on the Balance Sheet,Fraud,"In the asset category, companies can also overstate revenues through acceleration. This could come from booking multiple years of revenue at once. Companies may also manipulate revenues by comprehensively booking a recurring revenue stream upfront rather than spreading it out as it is expected to be received. Revenue acceleration is not necessarily illegal but it is not usually a best practice.",397,61,27
10264,759,Spotting Creative Accounting on the Balance Sheet,Fraud,"Inventory represents the value of goods that were manufactured but not yet sold. Inventory is usually valued at wholesale but sold with a markup. When inventory is sold, the wholesale value is transferred over to the income statement as cost of goods sold and the total value is recognized as revenue. As a result, overstating any inventory values could lead to an overstated cost of goods sold, which can reduce the revenue earned per unit. Some companies may look to overstate inventory to inflate their balance sheet assets for the potential use of collateral if they are in need of debt financing. Typically, it is a best practice to buy inventory at the lowest possible cost in order to reap the greatest profit from a sale.",729,126,27

The gross profit ratio can also be helpful if it is seen to fall unexpectedly or to be far below industry expectations. This means net revenues may be falling or extremely low because of excessive inventory expensing. Other red flags can include inventory increasing faster than sales, decreases in inventory turnover, inventory rising faster than total assets, and rising cost of sales as a percentage of sales. Any unusual variations in these figures can be indicative of potential inventory accounting fraud.",622,97,27

10282,759,Spotting Creative Accounting on the Balance Sheet,Fraud,"In general, pension obligations are a result of the present value of future payments paid to employees. One way to potentially manipulate this is through the discount rate used. Increasing the discount rate can significantly reduce the pension obligation. Companies may also overstate the expected return on plan assets. Overstating expected return creates more assets from which to pay pension liabilities, effectively reducing the overall obligation. Since pension obligations can be ongoing for a company, accountants could potentially make various adjustments over the full length of the obligations in order favorably manipulate net income in the short-term or at some time in the future.

If a company overstates assets or understates liabilities it will result in an overstated net income, which carries over to the balance sheet as retained earnings and therefore inflates shareholders' equity. Shareholders' equity is used in several key ratios that may be assessed by financial stakeholders when evaluating a company as well as for maintaining current financing arrangements such as credit lines. Some of these ratios may include debt to equity, total assets to equity, and total liabilities to equity. Comprehensively, shareholders' equity is also used in the calculation of return on equity (ROE), which is central to evaluating the overall balance sheet performance of a company as well as the performance of management.

10408,765,Analysis | Raghuram Rajan's latest warning on bank NPAs is an understatement of the real problem,Fraud,"Raghuram Rajan's warnings on the economy and banking have long been prophetic. The former RBI governor and IMF chief economist is credited with predicting the 2008 global financial crisis. In India, it isn't an exaggeration to say that Rajan's tenure as RBI governor between 2013 and16 changed the course of banking sector with the introduction of early identification of stressed assets and the subsequent implementation of asset quality review (AQR) in 2015. That forced banks to dig out the dirt long hidden under their balance sheets.",538,86,16

10412,765,Analysis | Raghuram Rajan's latest warning on bank NPAs is an understatement of the real problem,Fraud,"Earlier this week, Rajan again warned of a big NPA surge in Indian banking. During a virtual session at the India Policy Forum 2020 organised by Delhi-based think-tank NCAER, Rajan said India's banking sector would likely see an ""unprecedented increase"" in NPAs, or bad debts, over the next six months. ""The level of the NPAs is going to be unprecedented in six months from now if we really recognise the true level of NPAs...We are in trouble and sooner we recognise it, better it is because we really need to deal with the problem,"" he said.",543,96,16

Banks are unable to assess the exact nature of the stress on their books due to the moratorium. Hence, the only way to prepare for a possible spike in bad loans is to augment capital and make upfront provisions. Even if 5-10 percent of these loans turn NPAs, it could substantially add to the stress in the banking sector.",415,75,16
10418,765,Analysis | Raghuram Rajan's latest warning on bank NPAs is an understatement of the real problem,Fraud,That brings us to the question: how big will be the shock from moratorium loans?

10420,765,Analysis | Raghuram Rajan's latest warning on bank NPAs is an understatement of the real problem,Fraud,"The consensus is that around 5 percent loans could go bad. Global rating agency, Standard and Poor's expects gross NPAs of Indian banks to spike to 14 percent in FY21 from around 8.5 percent in FY20. “The COVID-19 pandemic may set back the recovery of India's banking sector by years, which could hit credit flows and ultimately, the economy,"" the agency said in a note last month.",381,67,16
10421,765,Analysis | Raghuram Rajan's latest warning on bank NPAs is an understatement of the real problem,Fraud,"Banks have sensed the danger already which is why they are on a capital raising spree. A number of private banks -- including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Yes Bank -- have announced plans to raise capital even though they have adequate capital levels. Analysts attribute this partly to expectations of an asset quality shock in the post moratorium period.",363,62,16

10424,765,Analysis | Raghuram Rajan's latest warning on bank NPAs is an understatement of the real problem,Fraud,"Since March, consumer demand has collapsed, business activities have slowed to a trickle in consumer-oriented sectors, manufacturing and services. Inflationary expectations have risen and tax collections have slowed. When people are hit with income losses due to pay cuts and mass layoffs, it is only logical that NPAs will spike across segments.",346,52,16
10425,765,Analysis | Raghuram Rajan's latest warning on bank NPAs is an understatement of the real problem,Fraud,The effect of this will be much severe on state-run banks which are at the mercy of the government for survival capital. The surge in bad loans will have a rippling effect in the economy as banks will turn even more cautious and risk averse to take further exposure. The second bad loan wave will kick off a vicious cycle in the economy. It will take a long time before one sees any recovery.,392,74,16
10426,765,Analysis | Raghuram Rajan's latest warning on bank NPAs is an understatement of the real problem,Fraud,"The sad part is that there is very little the RBI or the government can do about this except recapitalising banks and identify stress at early stages.

10428,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"A fundamental flaw in U.S. GAAP and IFRS financial reporting standards distorts the calculation of working capital and the current ratio, resulting in a significant understatement in most companies' liquidity. This outcome is detrimental not only to the companies but also to the economy overall, because it reduces the amount of credit available to businesses.",361,55,31
10429,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"A particularly negative consequence occurs when the flaw results in the reporting of a negative level of working capital—one of the stress alarms that auditors use to determine if they should report that a company is in danger of bankruptcy. Consider this common scenario: George has $5,000 to start a business and $200 in his pocket. He wins a lottery for a license to own and operate a taxi. He puts $5,000 down on a $25,000 car and borrows the difference, $20,000, on a five-year loan.",488,86,31
10437,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"What is George's “working capital”? According to conventional thinking, it would be defined as current assets ($200 cash) minus current liabilities ($4,000 CPLTD) or a negative $3,800. Right from the start of his business, George has a negative level of working capital. Moreover, with no inventory and no accounts receivable (since even credit cards clear in a day), George will have a negative working capital for the next five years.",436,70,31
10438,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,The common view of this situation based on this method of calculation is that George's business is illiquid and he won't be able to repay his loan. But that's not correct.,171,31,31
10439,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"Conventional accounting reports CPLTD among current liabilities because, logically, it is a liability due in the current period. However, that approach implies that CPLTD will be repaid from the conversion of current assets into cash.",234,35,31
10440,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"But, in reality, George will repay his loan with the revenue that he takes in using the taxi, which is a fixed asset.",117,23,31
10441,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"Here is the problem: The standard balance sheet fails to match the CPLTD with the fixed asset that repays it—the taxi. To truly “balance” our balance sheet in terms of what is current and what is long term, a new concept is needed—the current portion of fixed assets (CPFA). The CPFA is the portion of the fixed asset—the taxi—that will be used up in the current period to generate revenue. A simple accounting definition, and calculation of this concept, would be: The portion of fixed assets that will be depreciated in the current (next) period.",548,95,31
10442,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"In this example, if we assume the taxi has a five-year useful life, George will “use up” one-fifth of the taxi each year to generate cash revenue (a different expected life only changes the calculations, not the concepts). The “current portion” of the taxi, the CPFA, thus is $5,000 (or $25,000 divided by five years).",318,55,31
10443,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"Notice that, when CPFA is added to the balance sheet, as seen in Exhibit 1, each liability is now properly matched with the asset that it finances and that will repay it.",170,32,31
10445,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"As this exhibit shows, George is not illiquid. He has $200 (for an initial tank of gas and some food) and zero “current liabilities.” He will make his first loan payment from the cash revenue he collects this month, which is generated by using the taxi.",253,46,31
10446,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"George is not the only victim of the conventional approach to calculating working capital. Companies that have a large quantity of fixed assets and long-term debt—and therefore a large CPLTD—often appear to be tight on working capital, sometimes even reporting a negative working capital. Take CPLTD out of the equation, and their true liquidity is much rosier.",361,57,31
10448,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,“Best practices” in commercial lending use the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) to measure repayment of long-term loans. DSCR is calculated as: (Net profit + depreciation – distributions) ÷ CPLTD.,198,30,31
10449,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,The DSCR is a powerful ratio. It correctly captures the concept that the use of the fixed asset generates revenue that is used to repay the CPLTD. The portion of the taxi that is “used up” (depreciated) in generating revenue is effectively converted into cash flow.,265,46,31
10450,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"However, DSCR measures last year's depreciation expense against next year's loan repayment. A superior DSCR would pit next year's depreciation expense—calculated as CPFA—against next year's loan repayment.",205,27,31
10451,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"In George's case, next year's depreciation expense (CPFA) of $5,000 will be adequate to repay the CPLTD of $4,000. This equates to a DSCR of 1.25 ($5,000 ÷ $4,000) if we assume zero net profit and no distributions. At break-even (zero profit), the company generates exactly enough revenue to cover all expenses, including George's cash expenses (fuel, repairs, interest expense and a salary) and depreciation expense.",417,66,31
10452,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"To be clear, it is neither the depreciation expense nor the CPFA that repays the CPLTD. Revenue repays CPLTD. The depreciation expense only measures the portion of revenue that is available to repay CPLTD after all cash expenses are paid.",238,40,31
10453,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"There is, of course, a business risk that revenue could fall short of break-even. If the company suffers a net loss, there may not be enough revenue to cover both cash expenses and CPLTD. Of course, any company that consistently loses money will have a hard time repaying its long-term debt. A policy that requires some minimum DSCR would preclude long-term loans to companies that cannot at least break even.",409,70,31
10455,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"If the premise is accepted that CPLTD is repaid from CPFA and not from current assets, it must follow that the current ratio is flawed by including CPLTD as a current liability that must be paid from current assets. The distortion arises from the failure to match CPLTD with its source of repayment, CPFA.",305,54,31
10457,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"Solution 1: Focusing on the trading cycle. This approach would take CPLTD out of current liabilities, or at least adjust the calculation of working capital and current ratio accordingly. That would require inventing some new terms:",231,36,31
10460,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"Solution 2: Developing a new “current ratio.” The alternate solution is to leave CPLTD with current liabilities, but calculate CPFA and report it with current assets.",166,26,31
10463,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"Academics may debate whether the most appropriate treatment is (Solution 1) to move CPLTD from “current” back to long-term to match it with the fixed assets it finances; or (Solution 2) to take the portion of the fixed asset that is “current” and move it up with current assets. In either case, CPFA and CPLTD must match up.",324,58,31
10464,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"Either approach would be an improvement over the traditional measures of liquidity, but since the approaches provide different information, taken together they provide a clearer understanding of liquidity than was previously possible. A look at how cash flows in cycles reveals the unique contributions of the approaches.",321,47,31
10465,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"The “short-term cycle” only includes current assets and current liabilities that financed them and are repaid by them. Sometimes called “trading accounts,” these exclude CPLTD. By excluding CPFA and CPLTD from the formulas, Solution 1 provides a valuable analysis of the short-term cycle: Are current assets (traditionally defined to exclude CPFA) adequate to repay the short-term liabilities that financed them (excluding CPLTD)?",430,62,31
10466,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"The “long-term cycle” matches fixed assets with the long-term liabilities that financed them. However, CPLTD and CPFA complicate the understanding of short-term and long-term cash flow cycles because they contain elements of both cycles, as their titles indicate: “The current portion of long-term debt” and “the current portion of fixed assets.” They are, in fact, the “the current portion of the long-term cycle,” which places them at the intersection of both time periods.",475,73,31
10467,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"Notice that CPLTD appears in both the measure for the repayment of short-term debt—the current ratio—and the measure for the repayment of long-term debt—the DSCR. That is because the traditional current ratio encompasses both cycles, including both short-term liabilities and the current portion of long-term liabilities. The proposed “current period ratio” (Solution 2) shares this objective; however, it adds the missing piece—the CPFA—to the “current” assets, thereby pitting all assets that are converted into cash in the current period against all liabilities due in the current period.",591,87,31
10468,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"The current period ratio (Solution 2) is therefore the closer substitute for the old current ratio. The trading cycle ratio (Solution 1)—which is a narrower measure of liquidity than the current-period ratio—can be thought of as a substitute for the old acid-test ratio (or quick ratio), which also was intended to give a narrower measure of liquidity by excluding less-liquid accounts such as inventory. However, the old acid-test ratio suffers from the same flaw as the old current ratio—it erroneously suggests that CPLTD, included as a current liability, is repaid by the current (acid) assets.",598,95,31
10469,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"The decision going forward is not which of the two new ratios is more useful. Indeed, the greatest insight comes when the two ratios yield opposite indications. For example, a negative trading capital and a positive current-period capital would indicate that the short-term assets do not cover short-term liabilities, but the company is able to keep current because the long-term cycle is generating cash flow (CPFA) adequate to repay both the CPLTD and any shortfall in the short-term cycle. This situation may not be sustainable and may suggest that the mix of short-term and long-term debt is not optimal. Only by using the measures together is a more comprehensive understanding of liquidity possible.",705,113,31
10471,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,Discussion of these alternate approaches to assessing working capital is somewhat academic at this time because CPFA is not presently calculated and reported.,158,23,31
10472,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"CPFA is a new concept, but it is easy to understand: It is the portion of the fixed assets that will be “used up” in the coming year to generate revenue. And it is easy to calculate: It is the scheduled depreciation for the coming year, just as CPLTD is the scheduled principal payments for the coming year.",307,58,31
10473,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"CPFA should be part of standard reporting. Without CPFA, the traditional measures of liquidity routinely understate liquidity. AT&T, which reported a negative working capital of $14 billion at year-end 2010 ($20 billion current assets less $34 billion current liabilities), “appears” to be illiquid, but only because CPLTD is not matched with CPFA. The “appearance” of illiquidity may not hurt AT&T, but lenders generally shy away from small and medium-size companies that “appear” to be illiquid. The suppression of credit resulting from incorrect indicators hurts not only certain companies but also the economy as a whole.",625,95,31
10474,766,The missing piece in liquidity calculations,Fraud,"CPAs and auditors have an advantage over lenders and security analysts because they have access to the necessary raw data—the schedule of next year's depreciation—needed to calculate CPFA and a correct current-period ratio.

Antebi is scheduled to appear today by videoconference before U.S. Magistrate Judge Joel Schneider.",414,67,3
10678,778,Long Branch doctor charged in healthcare fraud billing scheme,Fraud,"According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:Antebi, a physician specializing in pain management and anesthesia, owned and operated a pain management clinic chain with five locations throughout South Jersey. Antebi was a participating provider in Medicare, Medicaid, and several private insurance plans. Between approximately 2014 through 2020, Antebi billed over $24.6 million for services he purportedly provided, including billing more than $15.3 million to Medicaid and more than $8 million to Medicare.The investigation showed that Antebi engaged in various forms of billing fraud. For example, Antebi frequently billed Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance companies on dates when travel records show he was overseas, including on trips to China, Israel, Turkey, the Dominican Republic, and across Europe, or when he was otherwise outside the State of New Jersey. Antebi billed approximately $230,700 to Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance plans between November 2015 and January 2020 for services he purportedly rendered while he was traveling and not in the office.",1109,163,3
10679,778,Long Branch doctor charged in healthcare fraud billing scheme,Fraud,"The investigation also showed that Antebi billed for excessive billings for one-day periods of time. For example, Antebi billed insurance plans for more than 24 hours' worth of services in a one-day period of time on more than 900 occasions between 2014 and 2020. Antebi also billed insurance companies for between 12 and 23.99 hours of purported services in a one-day period of time on more than 300 occasions. On certain occasions, law enforcement surveilled Antebi on days when he left the clinics early, but nevertheless billed as though he saw many patients on those days.Despite these high billings, individuals interviewed during the investigation stated that Antebi commonly saw them for only very brief periods of time, and he often did not perform any medical exams or evaluations during their visits. Individuals also indicated that that there sometimes was no medical equipment or examination tables in the rooms at the clinics in which patients met with providers, and that patients sometimes met with providers on folding chairs in the hallway of the clinics.The health care fraud count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The wire fraud and mail fraud counts each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense.

Unless anomalies are so obvious they cannot be overlooked, the finance employees will not conduct further reviews or queries.

12516,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"JOHN WARREN: Occupational fraud - we have a formal definition in our report which defines it as the use of one's occupation for personal enrichment through the deliberate misuse or misapplication of the employing organization's resources or assets. That's kind of a mouthful, and what we're really talking about here is insider fraud.",334,53,37
12517,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"Broadly this falls into three categories. There's financial statement fraud, which we've all heard about. Examples would be executives overstating an organization's assets or hiding liabilities to fudge the balance sheet or the income statement. The next category is corruption schemes which involve things like bribery, conflicts of interest, acts of economic extortion, or paying legal gratuities to officials as a reward for business or contracts. Then the last category is asset misappropriation. When we're talking about that, it's what most people typically think of as embezzlement - attempts to steal an organization's cash. Common examples would be submitting false invoices to the company, getting them to pay for non-existing goods and services or for personal purchases. Another example would be skimming, where an employee's skimming off receipts that come into the company before they're recorded, and it can also cover theft of physical assets, inventory or even theft of information in some cases. It's a pretty broad category, but again what we're really looking at is employees, managers and executives who are defrauding their employing organizations.",1170,177,37
12518,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"In terms of where it fits into the hierarchy of all fraud, we hear a lot about other kinds of fraud - healthcare fraud, identity theft - and those are huge, huge areas of fraud. We don't really know how large the problem of occupational fraud is for a few reasons. Most frauds run for a long time before they're detected, so at any given time there's fraud ongoing in a given organization that no one knows about yet. We can't really accurately measure how much fraud's going on at a given time. There's also no central repository where all fraud cases are collected, so we don't really have accurate data on how many cases of fraud occur within say the United States in a given year, and probably the most important problem is that organizations very frequently choose not to report fraud even after they've detected it. There may be concerns about lack of customer confidence. It could be out of desire to make sure the stock price doesn't take a hit. And very frequently they just don't want to deal with it or they deal with it civilly; they fire the perpetrator or they try to get some of the money back and they just try to kind of move on. They don't pursue criminal charges.",1182,218,37
12519,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"For all of these reasons, we don't have a real accurate measure of how large the problem is. However, I would speculate that it's probably the single largest form of fraud in the world in terms of both the number of occurrences and the losses. There are a couple reasons for that. Fraud schemes are by-in-large schemes of opportunity, meaning that people steal money where they have and see an opportunity to get access to money. When you consider the size of the global workforce, the number of people who are simply employed, and you consider that when a person finds himself in need of funds or with a desire to steal money from someone else, they will look to the place where they have the greatest opportunity to access someone else's funds. Their employer is usually going to be the most accessible avenue.",812,144,37
12520,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"If I got to work and I see checks passing across my desk everyday - say I work in accounting or I have access to the payable system and I run invoices through payables all the time for large of sums of money - it doesn't take such a big shift in my mental outlook to rationalize that, ""Well, I'll just run a couple of checks through the system and then I'll pay the money back. That way I don't feel like I'm really a criminal; I'm just somebody who has had a hard time."" Then of course, as time goes on, I don't pay it back. I end up stealing more and more money and the crime goes on until eventually I'm caught or I just disappear. That's basically when we're talking about occupational fraud - that's why I believe the problem is so incredibly large.",754,147,37
12522,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"FIELD: That's a great description of the types of occupational fraud. What do you find to be in your survey the hard, soft and even some of the hidden costs of these incidents you've described?",193,35,37
12523,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"WARREN: In our study we looked at 1,388 actual cases of fraud that occurred in different regions around the world and different companies. The median loss per scheme was $140,000 per fraud. That's not per company; again, I want to emphasize that. That's per scheme. We only look at one case at a time. In a large company, you may have dozens or hundreds of fraud schemes going on at one time, so the loss can obviously be very large.",433,80,37
12524,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"In addition, I would point out we measure median loss as a conservative estimate of the loss an organization has experienced. In other words, median means if you took all the frauds and arranged them from the smallest dollar loss to the largest, the median would be in the middle. If you look at the mathematical average, the average loss in these cases is well over a million dollars per scheme. We're talking about really high dollar, hard losses.",449,79,37
12525,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"In addition to those, you have other costs involved, including the cost of investigating the fraud. Once the organization discovers it's been defrauded, there are significant costs involved with investigation, both through your internal resources and very often you'll bring in outside accounting firms, law firms and investigators to help you sort through and figure out who took the money or how much money is missing. There are costs in terms of assessing that damage for attempts at recovery, trying to track down the money.",528,85,37
12526,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"Another cost that's involved is just the resources you divert from other operations, especially in the case of a very large fraud. You can find easily that a significant portion of your executive management, your audit staff, your outside accountants, are focused on dealing with this fraud that has already occurred instead of dealing with the primary operations of your business, which is a really big problem.",412,67,37
12527,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"Then, other hidden costs are the loss of trust within your organization. A company cannot function without placing trust in its employees. We have to at some level choose to trust that our accounting department is going to process payments in the correct way [and] they're not going to steal us blind; that our executives are going to operate in the best interest of the company and so forth. When you have a fraud scheme like that, it can really sever those bonds of trust. It can cause incredible damage to a company's morale and then you can have other ancillary financial losses - loss market capitalization; loss of consumer confidence; the company itself may end up facing criminal or civil legal action depending on the type of fraud. There is any number of costs that are associated with these crimes that go far beyond the median and average loss that we report in our study.",884,156,37
12530,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"WARREN: We break down the perpetrators of the fraud in a number of different ways. We gather quite a bit of information on the demographics of the fraudsters. At a high level, we break them down by position within the organization, from general level and authority. We find that about 42 percent tend to be employees, 38 percent managers and then the smaller number - just under 20 percent - fall into the category of owner/executive, although those individuals are the ones that cause the highest dollar losses. About half of the fraudsters fall in the age range of 31-45, but when you look in terms of loss it's the older fraudsters, the people 50 and above, who tend to cause the largest losses.",698,124,37
12531,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"Curiously, only about eight percent of fraudsters in our study historically commit fraud within the first year of tenure at their organization. When you're encountering an occupational fraud, it's usually somebody who has worked for you for a while. I think that probably relates to those people needing time to understand the company's internal controls, their culture, to know how to commit a fraud as well as the fact that most people don't start work at a company with the intent of defrauding it. They usually end up choosing to do that because they face some sort of financial problem of the kind I mentioned before - gambling debts, healthcare bills or whatever.",669,113,37
12532,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"About 65 percent of fraudsters tend to be male and that has been consistent throughout our study. Males also interestingly cause much higher losses per scheme, which has been very consistent since we started tracking that data back in '96. Then in terms of department within the organization - I think maybe the most important - we find that about 80 percent of frauds come from six departments within an organization typically. The most come from accounting, which usually makes up just under a quarter of the fraud cases we see, and then primary operations, sales, your executive/upper management department, the customer service and your purchasing department. Those are the six groups that will typically account for about 80 percent of the fraud in a given organization.",775,127,37
12534,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,FIELD: How are they most commonly being caught? Is it through technology? Is it through human audits? What's the break down?,124,21,37
12535,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"WARREN: Interestingly, despite all the advances we have in technology and emphasis on control, we find every year far and away the most common means of detection is through a tip. In 2012, it was 43 percent. Usually somewhere between 40-45 percent of cases are caught by somebody simply telling somebody else, ""I think this person is stealing or I think this person is doing [something] unethical.""",398,67,37
12536,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"The next most common methods are internal audit and management review, but we're looking at 15, 14 percent for those two categories. You're about three times more likely to detect a fraud via a tip then you are through any other method - internal audit, management review and so forth. What's interesting about that is that has been a consistent statistic since we started gathering detection data in 2002, and yet when we look at the controls that our victim organizations have in place, only about half of the companies, government agencies or whatever who were victimized had a hotline at the time they were defrauded. That's significant because a hotline, while not all tips come through a hotline, it's a very effective way of encouraging employees, customers and vendors to report concerns about misconduct. We think that's a relatively inexpensive way organizations could do a lot to bolster their anti-fraud efforts that are going to detect and prevent fraud.",967,160,37
12537,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"In terms of the tips that are received, about 51 percent of those come from employees. When we first started gathering that data, we thought that number would be higher. You would expect that 80-90 percent of your tips about misconduct would come from employees, but it turns out only about 50 percent. Customers tend to report fraud about 20 percent of the time. About 12 percent are anonymous so we don't really know where those come from. That's probably a mix of customers and employees. And then vendors are about 10 percent of the time, then sort of a hodgepodge in the other categories. But to the extents that an organization can take steps to encourage employees to understand what fraud is and how to report it, and to alleviate fears about being retaliated against if they do report it, I think that organization will go a long way to either reducing incidents of fraud or at least limiting its exposure to those schemes.",932,165,37
12539,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"FIELD: In your survey results, do you see different trends by region or by industry, or are they pretty much the same?",118,22,37
12540,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"WARREN: ... I should say we opened up the data internationally in 2010. This is the second year that we've gathered international data. Before that it was exclusively U.S. data. When we did that in 2010, we were expecting significant changes to our data set. We thought with gathering case information from Asia, Africa and Europe, we just expected we'd see a lot of different trends and surprisingly we found very few differences. The breakdown of perpetrators, the breakdown of losses, the most common schemes - it's all very, very common regardless of what region you seem to be operating in or even really with any industry.",628,107,37
12541,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"There are some small discrepancies. A couple of trends that have been surprising and we don't really know quite why we're seeing this data [is] losses have tended to be much lower per scheme in the United States and Canada than in other regions such as Asia, Africa and Europe in our studies. [We're] not really sure why that is. It may be just that to a large extent the data we gather, we're looking at cases that were investigated by certified fraud examiners. To a large extent that data is dependent on what kinds of cases CFEs are being asked to investigate and right now a big focus of the Department of Justice is in prosecuting FCPA violations, meaning Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations. So there's a big emphasis on dealing with corruption cases overseas.",772,136,37
12542,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"In our study, not only did we see higher losses overseas - and corruption cases tend to result in higher losses - but we see higher levels of corruption outside the U.S. and Canada. Now there could be any number of reasons for that, but one very likely reason is that our members outside the U.S. are devoting an inordinate amount of time right now to investigating cases of corruption because of the FCPA compliance responsibilities.",434,76,37
12543,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"The other trend that appears every time we do this survey is small businesses are disproportionately victimized by fraud. Organizations with fewer than 100 employees typically have the largest median loss per scheme, or if not the largest the second largest. They typically have losses per scheme higher than the very large store organizations we look at. Obviously, these small companies are generally not equipped to deal with these large losses, so fraud can be especially damaging to them.",493,79,37
12544,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"In [our] 2012 data, 32 percent of cases impacted companies with less than 100 employees and the median loss was $147,000 per scheme. Again, we see case after case after case where small businesses go out of business as a result of fraud cases. It's a terrible shame, and we also track the anti-fraud controls that organizations have in place and you can pretty directly trace this. Small companies tend to have fewer anti-fraud controls which make them more vulnerable, which causes them to have higher fraud losses and it's just sort of a vicious cycle these small companies get into.",585,101,37
12546,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"FIELD: Final question for you. If you could boil it down, what would you say are the essential steps that organizations really need to take to curtail the incidents of occupational fraud?",187,32,37
12547,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"WARREN: It's such a broad issue [and] topic. There are so many things we need to do, but what I would say, if there's a takeaway, is this - everybody knows about internal controls, that we should separate our duties, and people are taking in cash and not be the ones who are recording. We need to segregate duties. We need to have management review of our employees, and we need to check each other's work and so forth and that's all great; and controls are the most basic and important anti-fraud measure.",506,93,37
12548,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"But if people are going to take anything away from this study, what I would say is to look at the data on tips and the effectiveness of hotlines. We found that organizations with hotlines had a 44 percent lower loss per scheme than organizations without hotlines. Our data consistently shows that most frauds are detected by tips. You need to do everything you can to encourage your employees, your customers and your vendors to report any misconduct they see to you so that you can jump on these cases earlier and catch them before they spiral out of control into really large losses.",585,104,37
12549,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"What goes hand-in-hand with the implementation of hotlines is training for your managers and for your employees, because in order for these people to be able to report a fraud they have to know what a fraud looks like, and they have to know how to report it. Many people after the fact when we go in and look at these cases say, ""Yes, I suspected he or she was doing something wrong,"" but they weren't sure it was fraud or they weren't sure they should report it, or they didn't know who to talk to. You need to train your people on this. Tell them if you see something questionable, this is the phone number you call. What goes along with that is they have to know they won't be retaliated against. Many people who are aware of ongoing misconduct don't report it because they're afraid they will be fired or they'll be punished or they'll be associated with the complaint and be known as a snitch or something. You need to have an anonymous reporting mechanism where people can feel comfortable making the report without fear of retaliation. That's going to go a long way to reducing your exposure.",1099,201,37
12550,835,3 Steps to Mitigate Occupational Fraud,Fraud,"Then the other thing would be all the basic controls you have in place - enforce them. We see so many cases where a company had controls but either they did not routinely enforce them so people were allowed to override controls and segregation of duties broke down, or a high level person was able to override controls and just basically ignore the control structure in place. Have a hotline, train your people and enforce the controls you have in place. That's what I would say people ought to take from this study.",516,93,37

12557,837,"Occupational fraud, the threat from within",Fraud,"Along with the disproportionate victimization of small companies, the study found that the median amount of time that an employee committed fraud undetected was 18 months.

But in 22 percent of the cases, the loss exceeded $1 million.",393,65,9
12558,837,"Occupational fraud, the threat from within",Fraud,"Occupational fraud is tricky in that managers might think they're taking steps to stop it, but certain methods are surprisingly ineffective. Good corporate governance practices such as commissioning an independent financial audit, for example, might not catch employee fraud. According to the Fraud Examiners report, such audits caught fraudsters in only 3 percent of the studied cases. That's low — especially considering that 7 percent of fraud cases were discovered by accident. Independent financial audits may be part of doing business, but they will not necessarily prevent or detect fraud.",596,90,9
12559,837,"Occupational fraud, the threat from within",Fraud,"Furthermore, management may struggle to identify potential fraudsters, since the vast majority are first-time offenders.

12560,837,"Occupational fraud, the threat from within",Fraud,"Besides, background checks are ineffective against the most likely fraud perpetrators: employees who are already in the system. According to the study, 41 percent of criminals had worked at the company they defrauded for one to five years. A quarter of the perpetrators had worked at the company for over a decade. Less than 7 percent of frauds were committed within the first year of employment.

12561,837,"Occupational fraud, the threat from within",Fraud,"Still, many organizations have an “it can't happen here” mindset. The first step toward preventing occupational fraud is acknowledging it's a possibility. Then, like most risks, managers should address occupational fraud through strong management controls and insurance. Companies that don't have much capital on-hand can implement an anti-fraud policy, formal management reviews, as well as training and proper segregation of financial duties, all of which are effective and affordable fraud-prevention tactics.",512,71,9
12562,837,"Occupational fraud, the threat from within",Fraud,"Finally, business leaders should scrutinize their fidelity or crime insurance. While crime insurance is widely available at relatively low cost, many smaller and mid-size organizations do not buy it. Crime insurance can be written as a stand-alone policy, which can be customized, or included in a commercial package insurance policy. Either way, crime insurance protects organizations against a potentially devastating crime-related loss.

12928,860,The Risks of Fraud Collusion,Fraud,"The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), in reporting on collusion in its 2018 Report to the Nations(http://bit.ly/2BIITfH), indicates that there is a direct correlation between collusion and the cost of a fraud incident, rising from an average of $74,000 for one perpetrator to $339,000 for three or more perpetrators. While this trend is alarming, there is a paucity of research on the causes and mitigation of fraud perpetrated by collusion. Beyond this observation, however, the ACFE does not correlate collusion to lax internal controls. Moreover, collusion can easily override the basic tenets of segregation of duties, which is the foundation of good internal controls.",688,105,5
12929,860,The Risks of Fraud Collusion,Fraud,"When researching this article, the author had to rely on international studies that focused on the collusion trend in fraud. To that extent, the World Bank Group reports in its 2017 annual update that fraud collusion is rising (http://bit.ly/2Sfv65Y). Specifically, collusion accounted for 11% of all fraud reported between 2013 and 2016 (35 cases out of 311), but grew at a rate of 150% in 2017 to 22% (22 cases out of 100). Although the sample size is relatively small, and the method of accounting did change in 2017, this appears to be a disproportionally growing trend. Anecdotally, the author and colleagues also sense that this trend is growing.",652,109,5
12930,860,The Risks of Fraud Collusion,Fraud,"The reason for this apparent trend may be simple: managers, auditors, and even forensic consultants focus on good internal controls that assume that segregation of duties will make for good controls. With collusion, this assumption can no longer be made. Are auditors too focused on fraud by assuming that proper segregation of duties occurs without collusion? If so, what can auditors do to timely detect material misstatement due to fraud, or fraud due to collusion? This article attempts to answer those questions by exploring what the standards say about collusion, then understanding the nature of collusion, and finally combining that understanding with the audit standards' requirements to develop a set of likely responses when addressing financial statement fraud.",773,118,5
12931,860,The Risks of Fraud Collusion,Fraud,"Collusion as Defined AU section 316 contains two discussions about collusion. The first covers the general nature of collusion, but the second discusses it in a more nuanced form. Generally, it states: Fraud also may be concealed through collusion among management, employees, or third parties. Collusion may cause the auditor who has properly performed the audit to conclude that evidence provided is persuasive when it is, in fact, false.(emphasis added) Thus, the standard recognizes the risks of collusion and the elevated risk to the auditor in rendering an inappropriate opinion, colloquially known as “audit failure.” The standards were, however, amended to describe this risk in a more nuanced fashion, as stated in paragraph 86.12: Characteristics of fraud include (a) concealment through collusion among management, employees, or third parties; (b) withheld, misrepresented, or falsified documentation; and (c) the ability of management to override or instruct others to override what otherwise appears to be effective controls. (emphasis added) Thus, the amended standard brings to auditors' attention the issues with two types of fraud: asset misappropriation and financial statement misstatement (also known as “management fraud”). In the first type of fraud, employees, vendors, customers, and others must recruit, or at least coordinate with, their coperpetrators. As discussed below, this is not an easy task; in an asset misappropriation scheme, recruitment and coordination requires certain amount of risk by the individuals. In addition, such collusion could at times result in misstatement of the financial statements, although this might not rise to the level of a material misstatement. The second type of fraud requires less effort by management because managers who wish, for example, to post a debit to accounts receivable and a credit to gross sales would merely have to instruct a subordinate to post this journal entry; managers themselves often operate without much oversight. Even with a good segregation of duties, the audit standard posits, management is in an easier position to perpetrate material fraud. This increases the risk that auditors will miss the fraud.",2197,332,5

13396,869,Manafort's sentencing shows again that white-collar criminals get off lightly,Fraud,The first sentence meted out to Manafort in Virginia would be seen as entirely misguided by almost all legal experts. Judge Ellis essentially trivialized the seriousness of the charges and politicized them in his fully biased and inappropriate remarks during the trial as due only to the special prosecutor's quest to get to Trump.

Most, however, accepted that they did something wrong. Yet, in spite of this recognition, it wasn't clear even to the executives themselves why they made decisions that looked so thoughtless.

Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., that it is the president himself, not the executive branch, who possesses “the very delicate, plenary and exclusive power … as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations—a power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress.” Moreover, the president has plenary control within the executive branch of the intelligence power and classified information, which is defined, by the president, in terms of harm to national security.

13429,872,On What Grounds Can the FBI Investigate the President as a Counterintelligence Threat?,Fraud,"Because the president determines the U.S. national security interest and threats against it, at least for the executive branch, there is an argument that it makes no sense for the FBI to open a counterintelligence case against the president premised on his being a threat to the national security.

Those actions, therefore, cannot pose a threat to a national security as a justification for a counterintelligence investigation.

That is what a lot of Americans think of Trump, and it appears to be what the FBI suspected. Let's stipulate for purposes of argument that Putin has compromising information on Trump, and that the FBI has Trump on tape unambiguously pledging fealty to Putin and promising to serve as his agent in carrying out a number of concrete orders from the Russian president to damage U.S. intelligence operations (for example, by exposing U.S. spies and U.S. intelligence operations). In this situation (as Chuck Rosenberg asked me in a great episode of the Lawfare Podcast), could the FBI seek a FISA warrant premised on the claim that the president was an agent of a foreign power?",982,168,22

Did the bureau need to take that step? Was the FBI empowered to do something more and different by opening up a counterintelligence investigation against the president? Did it do so for a practical reason called for by the investigation, in order to ensure that it better understood what happened in 2016? Or was it just a formal bureaucratic step on which nothing of substance turned? This was a question that I raised on the podcast. None of my colleagues could say that anything at all of substance turned on the designation. (It was later suggested to me that the FBI's step might have enabled enhanced investigative steps against the president; the matter is unclear.) If it is true that nothing of substance turned on the designation, then in one sense the step was meaningless, and the FBI was able to proceed to investigate the president's connections to Russia and the 2016 election as before.

Think of some critics' view of Nixon's opening with China or, again, of Obama's with Iran and Cuba. Or imagine that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is elected in 2020 and brings controversial foreign policy views to the presidency.",504,79,22
13436,872,On What Grounds Can the FBI Investigate the President as a Counterintelligence Threat?,Fraud,"One danger in the what the FBI apparently did is that it implies that the unelected domestic intelligence bureaucracy holds itself as the ultimate arbiter—over and above the elected president who is the constitutional face of U.S. intelligence and national security authority—about what actions do and don't serve the national security interests of the United States. It further suggests that the FBI claims the authority to take this step on the basis of the president's exercise of another clear presidential prerogative—the firing of the FBI director in connection with the Russia investigation, which the Times says was the final predicate for the FBI's action. And it took this step did without any formal guidance on the books for applying counterintelligence rules to the president, akin to the special counsel regulations. Beyond the organizational and legal questions raised by these steps, if the FBI can open up a secret counterintelligence investigation of the president based on its belief that his actions threaten national security, it would chill controversial presidential foreign policy actions that the Constitution says are solely the president's decisions to make, for better and worse.",1207,186,22

But at one time, under J. Edgar Hoover, it secretly collected intelligence information on the president and other elected officials and used that secret information to influence the behavior of those officials. This is an ever-present danger with any intelligence bureaucracy in a democracy. A second adverse effect of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation of the president is that it gives credence to these types of concerns about the contemporary FBI—especially if the FBI opened a counterintelligence file on the president and did not notify him, as I suspect happened in the Trump case.",861,137,22
13438,872,On What Grounds Can the FBI Investigate the President as a Counterintelligence Threat?,Fraud,"In light of these implications, the question is whether the FBI's step outlined in the Times's story achieved any affirmative investigative goal. If it did not—if the investigation of Trump could have proceeded as a component of the Russia investigation without the FBI purporting to determine that the president is a national security threat—then this step strikes me as deeply imprudent. To be sure, the Times story also suggested that the decision was made in the confused and uncertain days after the Comey firing, and that it is “unclear whether Mr. Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter,” whatever that means. (Recall that the events described in the Times story occurred before Mueller was appointed, at about the same time that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in conversations with Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, reportedly suggested “that he secretly record President Trump in the White House to expose the chaos consuming the administration, and he discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office for being unfit.”) I hope that there is less to this story than meets the eye: that the story highlights a minor procedural step in a time of perceived crisis that was quickly deemed unnecessary or inappropriate and was reversed or dropped, and that the Times is now making it into a bigger deal than it was and is.",1403,229,22
13439,872,On What Grounds Can the FBI Investigate the President as a Counterintelligence Threat?,Fraud,"The Times story raises other hard questions. For example, what would happen if Trump, once he learned about the counterintelligence investigation of him, ordered it to cease on the grounds that he deemed it contrary to the national security interests of the United States? Would the FBI cease its investigation, or would it deem the president's order, like its interpretation of the Comey firing, as further evidence of the president's threat to the national security interests of the United States? Perhaps the official ordered to end the investigation would at that point resign, or would continue with the investigation until fired by the president. But these questions highlight the fraught position the FBI adopted in opening a counterintelligence investigation of the president based on its leadership's judgment that he is a threat to the national security.",864,136,22
13440,872,On What Grounds Can the FBI Investigate the President as a Counterintelligence Threat?,Fraud,"There are also hard questions on the other side. What exactly is the FBI supposed to do if it stumbles onto unambiguous evidence that the president is compromised, and acting on behalf of a foreign power, and has pledged to that foreign power to blow U.S. assets? As I noted above, I don't think there is a problem if the FBI, to the president's knowledge, investigates the president's actions as a collateral component of a broader counterintelligence investigation of a foreign operation. This has been happening for a while and I see no objection to the Mueller investigation as described in Rosenstein's order. The dangerous point comes if the FBI opens an investigation of the president, unbeknownst to him, based on its perception of his threat to national security. The line between these two things might be fudgable and the FBI might be able to collect all, or almost all, the information it needs without crossing the line. But it might also be that in some circumstances the only thing the FBI can do is to report what it stumbled upon to Congress and the American people and let them decide what to do.",1114,194,22

I also agree with David that the conundrum the FBI found itself in in the spring of 2017 was almost entirely attributable to the president's norm-defying (to put it mildly) behavior. But there is more at stake than just this president. As I have noted many times, one of President Trump's most nefarious skills is to act in norm-busting ways that cause people and institutions to respond to him in norm-busting ways. If indeed the FBI took the unprecedented step of opening a counterintelligence investigation directed at the president premised on his threat to national security, I hope the bureau had much stronger evidence for doing so than the Times story provided—and I hope that something of investigative substance actually turned on it.

The President of the United States got up on television and said, ‘I did this because of Russia.' ” They are, like, “What the fuck?,” right?

Yet, with his role in some of the era's most controversial inquiries — concerning Hillary Clinton's emails and Moscow's interference in the 2016 election — that spotlight found him, and Strzok got burned. Investigated by the Department of Justice and assailed by President Trump for the personal (and political) texts Strzok sent to an FBI colleague with whom he was having an affair, he lost his privacy, reputation and job. “After a quarter of a century in pursuit of the nation's enemies,” he writes, “I had been deemed an enemy myself.”",778,122,16

However, the FBI's Russia inquiry quickly identified a “wide breadth and volume of connections between the Trump campaign and Russia,” which troubled Strzok deeply. “If the American people had known what we did at the time of the election, they would have been appalled.” But unlike the Clinton matter, the FBI kept the public largely in the dark on its probe of the Trump campaign. “In the light of day on November 9,” Strzok writes, “that disparity of knowledge took on new significance.”",747,121,16

Strzok argues, for instance, that his text calling the Russia inquiry an “insurance policy” was meant to counter the argument that investigating Trump was less urgent because Clinton was likely to prevail. It's a plausible interpretation, and Strzok still thinks the analogy is apt. He is far less convincing when he contends that his message saying Trump would not win because “We will stop it” actually referred to voters writ large opposing Trump rather than, say, “we” in the FBI. “It was an artless comment but conveyed my firm belief that Trump . . . would not be chosen by the American people to become president,” he writes.

Still, he worries that Moscow could heighten its interference in 2020 — altering voting rolls; tampering with vote totals, even on a small scale; hacking into voting infrastructure; and, of course, releasing new kompromat that it's spent years collecting. “The Russians haven't gone away,” he warns. And he is concerned that his own experience might undermine the bureau's willingness to fight back. “If you were an FBI agent today, would you be looking to stick out your neck to show that Russia aims to repeat in 2020 what it did in 2016 — once again with Trump's explicit encouragement?”",791,129,16

13825,884,Peru and PH and dictators' offspring,Fraud,"SEATTLE—Much like in the Philippines, brand recognition appears to be highly valued by voters in Peru. Keiko Fujimori, daughter of former dictator Alberto Fujimori, currently holds a commanding lead in polls a month from the general elections. How could Peru and the Philippines both be looking at the possibility of the offspring of two of the most notorious dictators of the 20th century reaching the highest political offices of their respective countries? What is it about dictatorial dynasties that attracts voters?",520,81,9
13826,884,Peru and PH and dictators' offspring,Fraud,"Like Ferdinand Marcos after declaring martial law, Alberto Fujimori imposed an authoritarian model on Peru after his self-coup of 1992. Although some democratic forms were preserved, human rights violations were frequent, the press answered to the president, and massive graft became commonplace. These measures were framed as necessary in order to stabilize the economy and to successfully put an end to the dangerous Maoist insurgency of Shining Path. Of course, they remained in effect long after both objectives had been largely accomplished. Soon after being reelected for a legally questionable third term in office, Fujimori had to resign in 2000, amid accusations of voter fraud, corruption and abuse of power.",718,110,9

Also, like Marcos Jr., she studied abroad—in the United States—and has been accused of using public money to pay for her tuition. She does appear to have completed those studies, however. Her younger brother, Kenji, is also a congressman.",574,88,9

After a dismal period as congresswoman—in which she achieved the dubious distinctions of having one of the lowest attendance rates and number of bills submitted among all members of Congress—she ran for president in 2011, narrowly losing out in the ballotage against current president Ollanta Humala.

Furthermore, patron-client relations—if not outright vote-buying—run rampant in a society in which inequality is widespread. And while there may not be institutionalized avenues for setting up these relations—such as “pork barrel” funds—corruption and embezzlement fill the void to provide candidates with cash.

14646,917,The Russian Laundromat Exposed,Fraud,"DONATE Three years after the “Laundromat” was exposed as a criminal financial vehicle to move vast sums of money out of Russia, journalists now know how the complex scheme worked – including who ended up with the $20.8 billion and how, despite warnings, banks failed for years to shut it down. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) broke the story of the Laundromat in 2014, but recently the reporters from OCCRP and Novaya Gazeta in Moscow obtained a wealth of bank records which they then opened to investigative reporters in 32 countries. Their combined research for the first time paints a fuller picture of how billions moved from Russia, into and through the 112 bank accounts that comprised the system in eastern Europe, then into banks around the world. Reporters can now say that much of the money ultimately found its way to Russian businessmen who own groups of companies involved in construction, engineering, information technology, and banking. All held hundreds of millions of US dollars in state contracts either with the government directly, or with state-owned entities. They are named in this project and their spending sprees on fancy autos, prep school fees, furs, and electronics are revealed. Law enforcement in Moldova, Latvia, the United Kingdom, and Russia continue to investigate the Laundromat, but attempts to bring those responsible to justice and to recover the money have been hampered in part by the reluctance of Russian officials to cooperate.",1501,242,3
14647,917,The Russian Laundromat Exposed,Fraud,"Money to Play With Money entered the Laundromat via a set of shell companies in Russia that exist only on paper and whose ownership cannot be traced. Some of the funds may have been diverted from the Russian treasury through fraud, rigging of state contracts, or customs and tax evasion. Money that might have helped repair the country's deteriorating roads and ports, modernize the health care system, or ease the poverty of senior citizens – was instead deposited in a Moldovan bank. At the other end of the Laundromat, money flowed out for luxuries, for rock bands touring Russia, and on a small Polish non-governmental organization that pushed Russia's agenda in the European Union. (It is run by Mateusz Piskorski, a Polish pro-Kremlin party leader arrested for spying for Russia). Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi got paid too. The Hungarian-born, California-based psychology professor is noted for naming the psychological concept of flow – a highly focused mental state. Well-known companies unwittingly took part when beneficiaries used their Laundromat money to buy goods and services. South Korea's Samsung received laundered money, as did the Swedish telecom company Ericsson, and the toolmaker Black & Decker. In the United States, $500,000 went to Total Golf Construction Inc., the company that boasts of renovating a Donald Trump golf course on Canouan Island in the Grenadines.

A Worldwide Maze of Payments",1583,250,3
14648,917,The Russian Laundromat Exposed,Fraud,"The Laundromat was ingenious. Organizers created a core of 21 companies based in the United Kingdom (UK), Cyprus and New Zealand and run by hidden owners. A number of Russian companies then used these companies to move their money out of Russia. To get the money out, the scheme's organizers devised a clever misdirection. They created a fake debt among some of these core shell companies and then got a Moldovan judge to order the Russian company seeking to launder funds to pay that debt to a court-controlled account. Moldindconbank in Moldova held those accounts. The companies involved in the fake debt also had accounts at the same bank. Soon, Moldindconbank was deluged with cash sent in from the Russian companies. About $8 billion was then withdrawn directly from these accounts in Moldova and spent around the world. Meanwhile, nearly $13 billion more was transferred to Trasta Komercbanka in Latvia. Some of the money disappeared into the maze of these same shell company accounts. Trasta Komercbanka's location in the European Union made the transactions less likely to be questioned by other banks. The money was now considered “clean” European money that could be spent on anything the Russians wanted. The system worked well enough to launder some $20.8 billion – which can be seen in a database ​showing who received the money:​ Distributing the Money Between 2011 and 2014, the 21 shell companies fired out 26,746 payments from their various Trasta Komercbanka and Moldindconbank accounts. The payments went to 96 countries, passing almost without obstacle into some of the world's biggest banks. All of the core-group companies appeared to be owned by proxies standing in for hidden owners. Even directors and shareholders of the companies were fake. Some payments did go to genuine companies for real goods – but the transactions were made not by their clients, but by the 21 core companies using bogus copy-pasted paperwork which specified goods the company didn't sell.

One of Correa's men showed him into the dimly lit office and told him to wait in an empty conference room. Left alone, Peñas reached into his jacket pocket to turn on the dictaphone he had been using to record Correa and his top lieutenants for the past 18 months. As he waited, he tapped the table anxiously and walked over to the window to stare at the pouring rain outside. He received a message on his phone: Correa was running late. Peñas wondered whether Correa had gone somewhere public so that he would have an alibi for what might follow.

14739,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"After more than an hour, Correa arrived. What Peñas would record that evening would become the key piece of evidence in the most far-reaching corruption scandal in Spain's modern democratic history. The case would help shatter the nation's two-party system, transform how the public viewed the people running the country and, eventually, bring down a government. Originally centred on illegal dealings between small city councils and Correa's network of businesses, the investigation eventually swept up hundreds of suspects in its net. Investigators named the case “Gürtel” – a German word for “belt” – after Correa himself, whose surname means “belt” in Spanish. “Gürtel is Spain's Watergate,” said Peñas' lawyer, Ángel Galindo, last year.",741,113,64

14741,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"The effects of the Gürtel case – and a string of other scandals that have come to light over the past decade – are still shaking Spanish society. In 2015, spurred on by anger at political sleaze, coalitions backed by the leftwing populist party Podemos won mayoral seats across the country. Later that year, in general elections, Podemos and centre-right Ciudadanos dealt a definitive blow to the two-party system as, for the first time since the return of democracy, the vote was split between four major parties. But while anger over Gürtel has ended complacency over corruption, it also destroyed trust in public institutions and helped open the way for the return of the far right. In regional elections last year, a relatively new party named Vox campaigned on a hardline anti-immigration, anti-feminism platform, pitching itself as the only force capable of standing up to self-serving political elites. In December, it became the first far-right party to win seats in Spain in almost 40 years.",1000,165,64

He was ambitious, reckless and flashy. But when Peñas first encountered him, almost two decades earlier, those same qualities had a certain attraction. Correa was thrillingly confident and successful. “His name was synonymous with business,” Peñas told me. “He was the guy who pulled the strings.”",505,85,64

Peñas, then a councillor in Majadahonda, a commuter town just outside Madrid, was getting married. The local mayor, Guillermo Ortega, told him it would be good for his career to invite Correa – Ortega's key backer – so he did.

In February, Ortega resigned as mayor, officially citing health reasons, amid media reports of a falling out with PP leadership over his handling of an important land deal. A few months later, Peñas and another local PP politician publicly alleged that the same land deal was a scheme to defraud taxpayers. The case was investigated by anti-corruption prosecutors but later dropped when they found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Peñas and his colleague, meanwhile, were expelled from the PP – in retaliation, they claim, for their attempts to report corruption. (The PP declined requests to comment on why Peñas was expelled, or any other aspect of the Gürtel case.) Peñas found himself politically homeless, while the loss of a key ally had left Correa fearing that he would be frozen out of lucrative business opportunities in Majadahonda.

14745,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Initially, Peñas says, Correa's status and connections – he remained close to other senior PP figures even after the Majadahonda feud – made it impossible for him to consider that his financial backer was also corrupt. Peñas had seen signs of corruption before among colleagues, he said, but in late 2005, after overhearing Correa discuss a bribe so blatant he couldn't ignore it, he was forced to make a decision.",414,70,64

He had to get Correa on tape.",279,50,64
14747,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Peñas kept working on the new political party with Correa, but from early 2006 he began recording his friends and colleagues, hiding his voice recorder inside a folder he would place on the desk, or keeping it in his jacket pocket. “I was so scared. I feared that one day the recorder would start playing,” Peñas said. “I'm no spy.” Many hours of tape were inaudible and had to be discarded. “What really drove me was seeing that it was the People's party itself that was driving this,” Peñas told me. “Correa was just an individual but the People's party protected dozens like him.”",583,104,64

The family enjoyed a comfortable upper-middle-class life, until political unrest in the newly independent Morocco forced them to leave.

14751,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"In the mid-90s, after being introduced by mutual associates, Correa began organising holidays for senior members of the PP, establishing himself as a successful legitimate contractor. Years in the high-end travel industry had taught him how to cater to the rich and powerful, and by the end of the decade, Correa had progressed to organising campaign events for the party, later earning a reputation for staging flamboyant rallies in bullrings with elaborate firework displays.",477,74,64
14752,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"But Correa was not satisfied. Spain was booming and everyone knew the real money was in construction and lucrative public-private contracts. In a cluster of wealthy towns on the outskirts of Madrid, all traditionally controlled by the PP, Correa found a foothold where he could begin conspiring with local officials to rig certain contracts in his favour. Together they would inflate the price of a contract – building works, street cleaning, public information campaigns – award it to a company Correa controlled and make sure that everyone who mattered got a cut. A smooth talker, Correa was adept at “sobremesa” politics – informal “over dinner” business dealings – and began searching for more and more mayors who, in exchange for kickbacks, he could co-opt into the scheme.",778,127,64
14753,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"In time, Correa would build around him a revolving team of advisers: accountants, some of whom logged the steady stream of bribes and kickbacks; lawyers to construct elaborate offshore company structures that were used to hide money; charismatic dealmakers who solicited new marks for business and expanded operations beyond Madrid. His number two, Pablo Crespo, a former senior member of the PP in Galicia, helped cement Correa's connection to the party that became his most important client.",493,77,64
14754,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Dressed in designer suits, his hair slicked back, Correa had the air of a Wall Street banker attending a costume party as Al Capone. “He would pick up your bill, lavish you with expensive gifts,” David Fernández, a journalist who wrote a book about the Gürtel case, told me. “For many politicians who were easily corrupted this was incredibly attractive, and Correa knew how to exploit this. He had this gift for that old way of doing things in Spain.” Mayors and their families received holidays through Correa's travel company, or gifts of designer watches or sports cars. Over expensive dinners in Madrid's elite Salamanca neighbourhood, Peñas said, Correa would order wine but leave it untouched to retain a clear head. While his guests, politicians in charge of vast budgets, drank or chased women, Correa patiently watched for their weak spot. “With his ambition, nothing could stop him. If he saw the possibility of a deal, he went for it,” Arturo González Panero, former mayor of Boadilla del Monte, a wealthy town 10 miles west of Madrid, told me. Correa was “completely unabashed, unscrupulous”.",1105,184,64
14755,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"If bribery didn't work, he turned to blackmail. When Panero refused to cooperate, he claims that Correa threatened to end his career. Planning how to respond to the mayor, Correa allegedly brainstormed ideas with his right-hand man Crespo, who took notes on a pad of lined paper that was later seized from his office. “We don't want to fuck up your life,” read point one of 23. “He [Correa] has treated you like a brother and you've treated him like a dog.” If Panero didn't come around, the note continued, they would release a videotape of him, surrounded by piles of cash, taking a bribe. (Panero, who denies any wrongdoing, is currently awaiting trial in a further part of the sprawling case. He denies taking a bribe or any knowledge of the videotape. No such videotape was found during the investigation.)",811,141,64
14756,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"There were other pressures to get in line, Panero told me recently. Only 33 years old when he became mayor, Panero said the hierarchical culture of the PP meant it was difficult to push back when the party asked you to work with Correa or another favoured businessman. Panero alleges that Luis Bárcenas, then chief administrator of the party and later treasurer, ordered him to award contracts to specific companies. He claims to have refused to follow these orders, but speculates that others in his position could have been swayed by this kind of pressure. “It's not just the temptation of being offered 100m pesetas (£513,000) for a contract,” Panero said. “It's also the pressure of the treasurer of the party, a national leader calling you and telling you it's what the party needs.”",788,134,64
14757,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Correa, and others like him, thrived because, until recently, corruption was not seen as a major issue. After almost 40 years of dictatorship, Spain welcomed democracy in the late 1970s, and from the mid-1980s support for the political system was consistently high. Corruption was a problem, of course, but it was not a priority. In the early 1990s, long before the Gürtel case, the Socialist party – traditionally the other major force in Spanish politics besides the PP – was itself implicated in a string of financial and political scandals. But partly because there were few political alternatives for voters angry at corruption, the two major parties had little incentive to clean up their act.",699,115,64
14758,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Besides, most people had other things on their minds, not least the prospect of making money. In the housing boom that lasted from the mid-1990s to 2007, Spain built more homes than France, Germany and the UK combined. And it wasn't just housing. Towns with populations of tens of thousands built airports, while new roads and high-speed rail lines spread like spiderwebs across the country. And with each development came the opportunity for unscrupulous politicians and businessmen like Correa to rig contracts. Today, many of these dodgy housing developments and infrastructure projects stand abandoned, ruins of an age of excess. Trying to wean Spain off building, quipped one economist following the crash, was like quitting hard drugs.",741,117,64
14759,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Last summer, Peñas drove me around Majadahonda, the wealthy Madrid suburb that had once been the epicentre of Correa's business. “It's a museum of corruption,” he said, pointing out developments linked to Gürtel and other graft cases. Luxury housing developments and their accompanying garden oases crisscrossed the otherwise parched land wilting in the heat. Spanish flags hung on balconies of large apartments.

14762,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Throughout the time he was secretly making the tapes, only three people knew what Peñas was up to: his wife, one sympathetic colleague and a prominent local anti-corruption activist, Ángel Galindo, who became his lawyer. Peñas decided to tell Galindo around a year into the time he began recording. “I want to tell someone because I'm scared that I'm going to turn up floating in a river one day and that will be the end of it,” he told him.",441,80,64
14763,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"To demonstrate what was at stake, he played Galindo one of his recordings. On the tape, Correa could be heard talking about Galindo, discussing how to persuade him to give up his campaign against an allegedly corrupt deal. The recording stunned Galindo. “I had to get out of the room to get some air. It gave me a pain in my chest,” he told me. Once he regained composure, he played the recording again, and again, until he had listened to it more than a dozen times. “It was like lifting the blindfold and being confronted with reality. How things really work.”",562,102,64
14764,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"In May 2007, the fledgling party that Peñas and Correa had formed suffered a humiliating defeat in local elections, winning only 183 votes. After that, the pair lost contact. As Correa moved on to other ventures, Peñas and Galindo were busy transcribing the interviews and preparing the complaint they would take to the the police. Finally, on 6 November 2007, they went to the offices of the financial crimes unit of the Spanish police and handed them a CD containing almost 18 hours of recordings, transcriptions and a list of 30 names of people involved. Over several hours, Peñas told the officers his story while they took detailed notes.",643,109,64

It was the same hotel where Peñas had first decided to begin recording his boss, and it belonged to the same chain as the hotel where Correa had, all those years ago, begun his career as a bellboy. Decorated with red carpets and gold furnishings, the building oozed the kind of ostentatious wealth that Correa adored.",415,73,64
14767,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"That evening, as a police unit outside watched the hotel, Correa unburdened himself. A few nights earlier he had met with one of his longtime contacts at the PP, chief administrator of the party Luis Bárcenas, the man who controlled the party's secret accounts. The meeting had not gone well. Correa and Bárcenas, despite working together for years, reportedly had a difficult relationship. Bárcenas, Correa complained to Peñas, was cutting him off from new contracts.",468,75,64

Within days of the first raids, allegations of corruption, previously dismissed as an isolated problem, had hit senior PP officials across the country, throwing the party into chaos and provoking resignations. Dozens of suspects would be placed under investigation for a range of charges including bribing public officials, money laundering and belonging to a criminal organisation. Many of those arrested were respected public figures. One had even been vice-president of Spain's state oil giant Repsol, although he had left the company years before his arrest.

14774,921,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Six days after the raids, on 12 February 2009, the PP held a press conference to deny the party's involvement in any wrongdoing. In fact, they went much further, claiming to be victims of a leftwing conspiracy. The Gürtel case, they claimed, was an unprecedented partisan attack on the party, masterminded by the controversial judge Baltasar Garzón and ministers from the Socialist party, which was in power at the time. “This is not a PP plot,” said Mariano Rajoy, who was then leader of the PP. “This is a plot against the People's party.”",541,94,64

Within days of the arrests, and despite the investigation being sealed by court order, it was leaked that he was the whistleblower behind the recordings. In conservative Majadahonda there were many who viewed Peñas not as a whistleblower, but as a rat, an agent of a plot to bring down the PP. On the street, people sometimes harangued or spat at him. He began receiving threatening phone calls at home. In one incident later that year, Peñas told me, his wife, Raquel, was driving home with their two young children, when she was forced off the road by another vehicle, swerving into a ditch.

They were known as the indignados, the outraged ones. More than 6 million people took part over weeks of protests. National surveys showed overwhelming support for the movement, which transcended traditional party lines. A generation of young people with few job prospects began questioning the assumptions that had underpinned Spain's young democracy. “Gürtel was the ‘emperor has no clothes' moment for Spain,” said Carlos Delclós, a former indignados activist and author of a book on the movement and its political inheritor, Podemos. “Gürtel made it clear that it was not specific cases of corruption but that it was systemic. That corruption was the system.”",1001,157,64

Correa's testimony and the evidence of Bárcenas's ledger of payments in and out of the party slush fund had pushed him into a corner – among the names listed in that ledger was a certain “M Rajoy”.

Correa, who late in the trial had admitted his guilt for some crimes and pledged to cooperate with prosecutors, was sentenced to a total of almost 52 years in prison on multiple counts of bribery, money laundering, tax fraud and misappropriation of public funds.

The court found that ever since the party was founded, it had maintained a parallel accounting system to collect money from kickbacks that could be used to fund the party. The court said the testimony of Rajoy and other PP figures who denied knowing about the existence of the slush fund were “not credible”. The reputational damage was far worse than the actual punishment, which amounted to a fine of just €240,000.

Instead, they went to a restaurant near the presidential palace, where they remained holed up for eight hours, reportedly eating sirloin steak and drinking whiskey while the press laid siege. At 10pm Rajoy, bleary-eyed, left the restaurant to the flashes of a horde of waiting photographers. The next day, parliament ousted Rajoy's administration in a vote of no confidence – a first in post-Franco Spain – and in its place, the Socialists formed a minority government.",721,117,64

Before the crisis, satisfaction with the political system in Spain was among the highest in Europe, behind only Denmark, Luxembourg and Finland. After 2010, in the wake of austerity and endless corruption scandals, trust in institutions such as political parties and banks crumbled. Gürtel, like Watergate, has convinced many voters to take a conspiratorial view of politics. When a courthouse in Valencia that heard part of the Gürtel trial suffered a fire in 2017, there were immediate suspicions of foul play, and social-media hoaxes spread the theory that evidence in other PP corruption cases had been destroyed.

15017,923,How Have Corruption Scandals and President Roussef's Impeachment in Brazil Impacted its Economy?,Fraud,"Abstract In 2009, Brazil was in the path to become a superpower. Immune to the economic crises of 2008, the country's economy benefitted from the commodity boom, achieving a growth rate of 7.5 per cent in 2010, when Rousseff was elected. A few years later, nonetheless, Brazil's boom turned into an economic bust. In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in its history denounced the involvement of major politicians, including then-President Rousseff, in schemes of money laundering. In this essay, I analyze the impacts of such scandals and Rousseff's impeachment on the Brazilian economy. I argue that these two events contributed indirectly to Brazil's economic instability, as they shone a light on larger structural problems such as unemployment and high public expenditures. Looking at the future, I conclude by discussing the challenges that face Temer's administration.",877,135,33
15019,923,How Have Corruption Scandals and President Roussef's Impeachment in Brazil Impacted its Economy?,Fraud,"On October 8, 2016, I was sitting at the Wilson Center listening to Brazil's current finance minister, Mr. Henrique Meirelles, suggest that the ongoing financial crisis in Brazil is as severe, if not worse, than the Great Depression. As I looked around the room, everyone's faces looked puzzled, worried, hopeless. The accumulation of lower commodity prices, corruption, impeachment, and inflation present in the last four years have shaken the Brazilian economy severely. Prices have skyrocketed, investors have fled, unemployment increased, and stagnation has arrived. In this paper, I analyze two specific factors that contributed to the chaotic economic situation in Brazil: the corruption scandals involving the state-owned company Petrobras and the subsequent impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. I argue that these two events indirectly contributed to the economic situation of the country as they magnified the political instability in Brazil. To support my argument, I start by analyzing the political rise of Dilma Rousseff. Then I discuss the momentum she received in 2010 from the economic boom and the Lula years. After giving a background on Rousseff's debut as President of the Republic, I provide a detailed explanation of the Car Wash Operation since its start in 2009. Lastly, I analyze the political and economic consequences that the corruption scandal brought to Brazil, including Rousseff's impeachment. I conclude by discussing the challenges that face Temer's administration.",1503,226,33
15021,923,How Have Corruption Scandals and President Roussef's Impeachment in Brazil Impacted its Economy?,Fraud,"Dilma Rousseff's debut as a Brazilian politician did not start in the twenty-first century as many would argue. Much earlier than that, in 1964, sixteen-year-old Rousseff served as a militant for the VAR-Palmares, an armed revolutionary organization that fought against the military dictatorship in Brazil. This organization, influenced by Debray's Revolution in the Revolution and Fidel Castro's success in Cuba, found an answer for Brazil in Marxism. However, in a repressive far-right military regime, VAR-Palmares lacked political rights. In 1970, Rousseff was arrested in São Paulo under charges of subversion. Condemned to six years in prison, Dilma lost her political rights. Her body still carries scars from the torture she experienced at the Tiradentes prison (Amaral, 2011).",785,117,33

Her involvement with the PDT coined her official debut in a legally recognized political organization. Through the PDT, Rousseff was elected Porto Alegre's Municipal Finance Secretary between 1985 and 1988. In 1989, she became director general of Porto Alegre's City Council under the administration of Alceu Collares. In 1991, Collares appointed Rousseff as the president of the Foundation of Economics and Statistics, where she served until being elected the state's Secretary of Energy, Mines and Communications in 1993 (Amaral, 2011).",712,107,33
15023,923,How Have Corruption Scandals and President Roussef's Impeachment in Brazil Impacted its Economy?,Fraud,"A few years later, Rousseff's trajectory with the Worker's Party (PT) would begin. In 1998, she helped PT-candidate for state governor Olivio Dutra to win an election in Rio Grande do Sul. By then, Rousseff's de facto affiliation had turned from the PDT to the PT – a fact confirmed later that year when she left PDT after the party decided to break with the PT. In 2001, Dilma's preference for the Worker's Party went viral. In 2003, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva appointed Rousseff as his Minister of Mining and Energy (Amaral, 2011). In the same year, Rousseff became the President of the Board of the Directors of Brazil's largest oil and state-owned enterprise (SOE), Petrobras. She presided over the SOE's board for seven years, resigning in 2010 to run for Brazil's presidency (Tavares, 2016).",806,137,33
15024,923,How Have Corruption Scandals and President Roussef's Impeachment in Brazil Impacted its Economy?,Fraud,"Two years after being nominated Minister of Mining and Energy, Rousseff had proven to be a firm, competent politician who could handle Brasilia quite well. Lula, impressed by her skills and desperate to find a replacement for his Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu, who was caught in the mensalão, the largest corruption scandal of Brazilian political history until then, fell on her. In Rousseff, he found a friend and the fuel needed to reset Brasilia's engine. In 2005, Lula appointed Dilma as his newest Chief of Staff. He trusted her not only to manage Brazil's ministries, but also two of his administration's major programs. The first, ""Minha Casa, Minha Vida,"" (my house, my life) promoted affordable housing for those living in poverty in Brazil. The second, ""Programa de Aceleração de Crescimento"" (growth acceleration program, also known as PAC), provided an economic stimulus package with investment projects in Brazil. This program was particularly responsible for increasing Rousseff's reputation, as Lula proudly entitled her the ""mother of the PAC"" (Amaral, 2011).",1072,169,33

The economy grew 7.5 per cent, unemployment kept low at 5 per cent (see figures 3 and 5), and the Brazilian Real was at its strongest rates since the implementation of the Real Plan (see appendix, Fig. I). In addition, as Besta points out, 2010 "" saw the highest increase in monthly incomes of Brazilians at 1490.61 Brazilian real ($893.4), up 19 percent compared with levels in 2003. Per capita income was up 5.5 percent in 2010 compared with 2009"" (2011). These numbers, subsequents of other factors like commodity prices boom and the discovery of Brazil's pre-salt, convinced Brazil's new middle-class, children of the cash transfer program Bolsa Familia, that reelecting the Worker's Party would serve them well. Rousseff's reelection thus served as a referendum on the Lula years and an engine to catalyze Brazil's potential overseas.",888,145,33

The first years of Rousseff's administration were filled with momentum to see Brazil step into the role of global leader. However, the end of 2013 served as presage to a large group of politicians, including Lula and Rousseff, that the years to come would not be so glorious. The economy had stagnated with an annual growth of 0.9 per cent (see figure 3) and the June 2013 protests demonstrated the population's dissatisfaction with the Worker's Party administration. With more than 2 million people taking over the streets, they protested against rampant increases in bus fares, inflation, corruption, and lack of investment in education and infrastructure. By the end of the year, the media that had responded so positively to previous PT years started to question Brazil's direction. One year away from the World Cup, the international press doubted whether Brazil was ready to host the global event (Vanegas, 2013). In September 2013, The Economist asked ""Has Brazil Blown It?""

Initiated in 2009, the Car Wash Operation, named after a network of gas stations and car washes that to managed illicit resources pertaining to a criminal organization in Brazil, investigated a Federal Deputy from the state of Paraná, accused of money laundering (MPF, 2016). The MP also investigated Alberto Youssef, a black market dollar dealer who was already familiar to the Federal Police. In 2013, telephone interceptions monitored conversations among several dollar dealers in order to obtain further information on the criminal organizations charged with money laundering (MPF, 2016). In July of that year, the Police learned about Youssef's car donation to a former Director of Petrobras, Paulo Roberto Costa (MPF, 2016). This discovery led the Police to suspect that these criminal organizations' network for money laundering was larger than ever thought. The investigations did not only involve politicians who had previously been involved in this kind of corruption scandals, but they also involved businessmen and contractor companies across the country.",1162,174,33
15034,923,How Have Corruption Scandals and President Roussef's Impeachment in Brazil Impacted its Economy?,Fraud,"As the Federal Police, along with the Public Prosecutor's Office, denounced the dimension and severity of the Car Wash Operation, the economy reacted in despair. The first phase of the Car Wash investigations happened in March 2014. In this phase, the Police along with the MP arrested 17 people, including dollar dealer Alberto Youssef and former Director of Petrobras, Paulo Roberto da Costa (MPF, 2016). Since then, political and economic turmoil arose in Brazil as the Operation would discover more people involved every single day. In April 2014, the scandal had escalated so deeply that a Parliamentary Inquiry Commission (CPI) on Petrobras was installed in the Senate to address issues pertaining solely to the corruption revealed in the Car Wash Operation (G1, 2016). In June, already in its fourth phase, the investigations revealed that most of the money laundered had been deposited into bank accounts in fiscal havens, such as Monaco and Switzerland. Among the owners of these accounts was Paulo Roberto da Costa (Borges, 2016). When invited to testify about the issue, nonetheless, Costa became known as a whistleblower. Speaking under a plea bargain, Costa explained how the laundering schemes worked. In addition, as he denounced major players in these schemes, he cited the involvement of President Dilma Rousseff (Borges, 2016; MPF, 2016). By September 2014, the Car Wash Operation confirmed that part of the money laundering was illegally used to fund 2010 political campaigns from major parties, including Rousseff's PT and VP Michel Temer's PMDB (Borges, 2016). By the end of the year, the Operation had reached the seventh phase, arrested 39 people, and investigated four major Brazilian contractor companies: OAS, Odebrecht, Camargo Correa, and Queiroz Galvão (Borges, 2016).",1797,281,33

The economic indicators were not showing an optimistic scenario. In 2014, the economy grew only 0.1 percent while inflation reached 6.41 percent (see figures 2 and 3). Talks about a recession dominated the news, while frustration dominated people's conversations about the government. Mistrusting the Worker's Party administration, Brazilians feared that the 6.8 percent unemployment rate would skyrocket (Borges, 2016). In addition, as the dollar continued to quickly appreciate, they feared that the bust after the boom had arrived. The same media outlets that had partaken in Brazil's exhilaration around 2010 now expressed their woes.

In November 2014, Dilma Rousseff was re-elected president after a runoff against the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) candidate Aécio Neves with 51.6% of the votes (G1, 2014). Even though the Car Wash Operation did not compromise the Worker's Party ability to re-elect Rousseff as President in 2014, the scandal and the economic despair dominating Brazil at the time alarmed Brasilia that instability was on the rise. Early in January 2015, then President of Petrobras, Graça Foster, suggested that the company had lost R$ 88,6 billion due to the Car Wash Scandal (G1, 2015). In February, a former manager of operations of Petrobras revealed that the Worker's Party had received somewhere between US$ 150 to US$ 200 million in one bribery contract (MPF, 2016). A few months later, as the investigation reached its twelfth phase, Folha de São Paulo, a renowned newspaper in Brazil, published an interview with Ricardo Pessoa, a contractor CEO who claimed that his company had donated R$ 7.5 million to Dilma Rousseff's reelection campaign (MPF, 2016).",1198,191,33

In 2015 alone, the investigation had fourteen phases, arresting more than forty people, condemning more than twelve, and recovering more than R$870 million (G1, 2016). Through these operations, the presidents of contractor companies such as Odebrecht were arrested. Politicians such as former Presidents of Brazil Fernando Collor and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, then-Presidents of the House and of the Senate, Eduardo Cunha and Renan Calheiros, respectively, and former Chief of Staff José Dirceu were denounced for being involved in major money laundering schemes.",905,141,33

Economic indicators demonstrated that the economy had contracted by 3.8 per cent in 2015, while inflation had escalated to 10.67 per cent (see figures 3 and 4). The Brazilian Real had been severely depreciated as the exchange rate against the US dollar appreciated to 3.95943 (see appendix, Fig. I).

They claimed she had authorized R$2.5 billion of additional expenses between July and August 2015. According to the Law, such authorization could not have happened since government expenditures did not match the fiscal goals for the year, especially since the administration was committed to increase its savings to pay the public debt (G1, 2016). Rousseff was also charged for borrowing money from other federal institutions such as the Central Bank and the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) to finance her government's social programs in 2015, as cash transfer Bolsa Familia and Plano Safra (G1, 2016). This is known as a ""fiscal pedal"" in Brazil, as the government seeks to disguise a breakdown in the public accounts.

As Temer appointed his cabinet, he carefully selected conservative technocrats who would take Brazil to a route much different from that during the PT years.

The Operation, with the help of the press, was able to reveal the expansive network of corrupted politicians across Brazil. Such revelation did not give room for people's political complacency. For the first time, a corruption scandal compromised political parties and their members. In this way, the corruption scandal contributed to the political instability in the country. In addition, the scandal also played a role impacting the economic instability in Brazil. As corruption schemes and political instability were revealed to the public, investments decreased severely. Compromising Brazil's credibility, the Car Wash Operation and the impeachment spillovers detracted foreign investment. As Figure 1 shows, from 2014 to 2016, FDI decreased by almost US$20 billion. Moreover, domestic investments also decreased. The continuous increase in the interest rate has prevented investors from borrowing money (see appendix, fig. IV), and the involvement of major contractor companies in the corruption scandals have left no one to work on big infrastructure projects in the country.

In this case, the impacts of the two events analyzed might be indirectly related, nonetheless still present. The mismanagement of the economy has caused inflation to reach almost 11 per cent in 2015. This inflation, followed by the lack of investments, and the decline in economic activity may have decreased the number of jobs available in the market. Figures 4 and 5 show the price fluctuation as well as the unemployment rate in the last years. For Bruno Lavieri, ""blaming the Car Wash Operation [for unemployment and stagnation] is like blaming the doctor for finding his patient's disease."" However, as GO Associates have argued, this indirect impact of the investigations have costed more than 2 million jobs in two years due to the lack of infrastructure projects with Petrobras and contractor companies (UOL, 2016). Petrobras alone composed 13 per cent of the economic activities in Brazil (Petrobras, 2016). According to Getúlio Vargas Foundation, ""the decrease in Petrobras' activities due to the Car Wash Operations could take away R$7 billion from the economy, lead to the loss of more than 1 million vacancies and a R$ 5.7 billion fall in the collection of taxes by the Union, states and municipalities in 2015"" (UOL, 2016).",1345,223,33

In the aftermath, Uzbek prisons swelled with thousands of new inmates, many of whom were not connected to any radical group. Tashkent continued with Soviet-style heavy-handedness, with the government overseeing the Islamic hierarchy, imams' sermons, and the contents of religious texts. Those who practiced Islam outside this state-controlled system were seen as terrorists or extremist sympathizers.

Despite counterterrorism cooperation, ties between Washington and Tashkent never truly warmed, with Karimov increasingly suspicious of American intentions.

Exactly what happened next remains disputed, but what is known is that the Uzbek military sent in troops and opened fire on protesters, killing hundreds of civilians, including women and children. Washington remained hesitant at first to press the issue with Tashkent, issuing some cautious statements about the incident while stymying attempts at a probe (including one particularly cynical effort by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld).

This was at a time when dissection was considered so ignominious, it was sometimes used as punishment - public dissection following execution. In light of this, it is not surprising that Michelangelo combined his technique of conveying subtext and meaning through visual codes, with his radically counter-current convictions on women and deities. “In times of intolerance and religious persecution, art almost never dared to openly express what the artist was eager to communicate,"" the authors of The Clinical Anatomy study posit.

The case would help shatter the nation's two-party system, transform how the public viewed the people running the country and, eventually, bring down a government. Originally centred on illegal dealings between small city councils and Correa's network of businesses, the investigation eventually swept up hundreds of suspects in its net. Investigators named the case “Gürtel” – a German word for “belt” – after Correa himself, whose surname means “belt” in Spanish. “Gürtel is Spain's Watergate,” said Peñas' lawyer, Ángel Galindo, last year.",741,113,64

Later that year, in general elections, Podemos and centre-right Ciudadanos dealt a definitive blow to the two-party system as, for the first time since the return of democracy, the vote was split between four major parties. But while anger over Gürtel has ended complacency over corruption, it also destroyed trust in public institutions and helped open the way for the return of the far right. In regional elections last year, a relatively new party named Vox campaigned on a hardline anti-immigration, anti-feminism platform, pitching itself as the only force capable of standing up to self-serving political elites.

He was ambitious, reckless and flashy. But when Peñas first encountered him, almost two decades earlier, those same qualities had a certain attraction. Correa was thrillingly confident and successful. “His name was synonymous with business,” Peñas told me. “He was the guy who pulled the strings.”",505,85,64

Peñas, then a councillor in Majadahonda, a commuter town just outside Madrid, was getting married. The local mayor, Guillermo Ortega, told him it would be good for his career to invite Correa – Ortega's key backer – so he did.

15234,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Over the next few years, Peñas and Correa saw little of each other but in 2005, that all changed. In February, Ortega resigned as mayor, officially citing health reasons, amid media reports of a falling out with PP leadership over his handling of an important land deal. A few months later, Peñas and another local PP politician publicly alleged that the same land deal was a scheme to defraud taxpayers. The case was investigated by anti-corruption prosecutors but later dropped when they found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Peñas and his colleague, meanwhile, were expelled from the PP – in retaliation, they claim, for their attempts to report corruption. (The PP declined requests to comment on why Peñas was expelled, or any other aspect of the Gürtel case.) Peñas found himself politically homeless, while the loss of a key ally had left Correa fearing that he would be frozen out of lucrative business opportunities in Majadahonda.

15235,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Initially, Peñas says, Correa's status and connections – he remained close to other senior PP figures even after the Majadahonda feud – made it impossible for him to consider that his financial backer was also corrupt.

He had to get Correa on tape.",279,50,64
15237,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Peñas kept working on the new political party with Correa, but from early 2006 he began recording his friends and colleagues, hiding his voice recorder inside a folder he would place on the desk, or keeping it in his jacket pocket. “I was so scared. I feared that one day the recorder would start playing,” Peñas said. “I'm no spy.” Many hours of tape were inaudible and had to be discarded. “What really drove me was seeing that it was the People's party itself that was driving this,” Peñas told me. “Correa was just an individual but the People's party protected dozens like him.”",583,104,64

The family enjoyed a comfortable upper-middle-class life, until political unrest in the newly independent Morocco forced them to leave.

15241,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"In the mid-90s, after being introduced by mutual associates, Correa began organising holidays for senior members of the PP, establishing himself as a successful legitimate contractor. Years in the high-end travel industry had taught him how to cater to the rich and powerful, and by the end of the decade, Correa had progressed to organising campaign events for the party, later earning a reputation for staging flamboyant rallies in bullrings with elaborate firework displays.",477,74,64
15242,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"But Correa was not satisfied. Spain was booming and everyone knew the real money was in construction and lucrative public-private contracts. In a cluster of wealthy towns on the outskirts of Madrid, all traditionally controlled by the PP, Correa found a foothold where he could begin conspiring with local officials to rig certain contracts in his favour. Together they would inflate the price of a contract – building works, street cleaning, public information campaigns – award it to a company Correa controlled and make sure that everyone who mattered got a cut. A smooth talker, Correa was adept at “sobremesa” politics – informal “over dinner” business dealings – and began searching for more and more mayors who, in exchange for kickbacks, he could co-opt into the scheme.",778,127,64
15243,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"In time, Correa would build around him a revolving team of advisers: accountants, some of whom logged the steady stream of bribes and kickbacks; lawyers to construct elaborate offshore company structures that were used to hide money; charismatic dealmakers who solicited new marks for business and expanded operations beyond Madrid. His number two, Pablo Crespo, a former senior member of the PP in Galicia, helped cement Correa's connection to the party that became his most important client.",493,77,64
15244,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Dressed in designer suits, his hair slicked back, Correa had the air of a Wall Street banker attending a costume party as Al Capone. “He would pick up your bill, lavish you with expensive gifts,” David Fernández, a journalist who wrote a book about the Gürtel case, told me. “For many politicians who were easily corrupted this was incredibly attractive, and Correa knew how to exploit this. He had this gift for that old way of doing things in Spain.” Mayors and their families received holidays through Correa's travel company, or gifts of designer watches or sports cars. Over expensive dinners in Madrid's elite Salamanca neighbourhood, Peñas said, Correa would order wine but leave it untouched to retain a clear head. While his guests, politicians in charge of vast budgets, drank or chased women, Correa patiently watched for their weak spot. “With his ambition, nothing could stop him. If he saw the possibility of a deal, he went for it,” Arturo González Panero, former mayor of Boadilla del Monte, a wealthy town 10 miles west of Madrid, told me. Correa was “completely unabashed, unscrupulous”.",1105,184,64
15245,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"If bribery didn't work, he turned to blackmail. When Panero refused to cooperate, he claims that Correa threatened to end his career. Planning how to respond to the mayor, Correa allegedly brainstormed ideas with his right-hand man Crespo, who took notes on a pad of lined paper that was later seized from his office. “We don't want to fuck up your life,” read point one of 23. “He [Correa] has treated you like a brother and you've treated him like a dog.” If Panero didn't come around, the note continued, they would release a videotape of him, surrounded by piles of cash, taking a bribe. (Panero, who denies any wrongdoing, is currently awaiting trial in a further part of the sprawling case. He denies taking a bribe or any knowledge of the videotape. No such videotape was found during the investigation.)",811,141,64
15246,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"There were other pressures to get in line, Panero told me recently. Only 33 years old when he became mayor, Panero said the hierarchical culture of the PP meant it was difficult to push back when the party asked you to work with Correa or another favoured businessman. Panero alleges that Luis Bárcenas, then chief administrator of the party and later treasurer, ordered him to award contracts to specific companies. He claims to have refused to follow these orders, but speculates that others in his position could have been swayed by this kind of pressure. “It's not just the temptation of being offered 100m pesetas (£513,000) for a contract,” Panero said. “It's also the pressure of the treasurer of the party, a national leader calling you and telling you it's what the party needs.”",788,134,64
15247,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Correa, and others like him, thrived because, until recently, corruption was not seen as a major issue. After almost 40 years of dictatorship, Spain welcomed democracy in the late 1970s, and from the mid-1980s support for the political system was consistently high. Corruption was a problem, of course, but it was not a priority. In the early 1990s, long before the Gürtel case, the Socialist party – traditionally the other major force in Spanish politics besides the PP – was itself implicated in a string of financial and political scandals. But partly because there were few political alternatives for voters angry at corruption, the two major parties had little incentive to clean up their act.",699,115,64
15248,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Besides, most people had other things on their minds, not least the prospect of making money. In the housing boom that lasted from the mid-1990s to 2007, Spain built more homes than France, Germany and the UK combined. And it wasn't just housing. Towns with populations of tens of thousands built airports, while new roads and high-speed rail lines spread like spiderwebs across the country. And with each development came the opportunity for unscrupulous politicians and businessmen like Correa to rig contracts. Today, many of these dodgy housing developments and infrastructure projects stand abandoned, ruins of an age of excess. Trying to wean Spain off building, quipped one economist following the crash, was like quitting hard drugs.",741,117,64
15249,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Last summer, Peñas drove me around Majadahonda, the wealthy Madrid suburb that had once been the epicentre of Correa's business. “It's a museum of corruption,” he said, pointing out developments linked to Gürtel and other graft cases.

15252,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Throughout the time he was secretly making the tapes, only three people knew what Peñas was up to: his wife, one sympathetic colleague and a prominent local anti-corruption activist, Ángel Galindo, who became his lawyer. Peñas decided to tell Galindo around a year into the time he began recording. “I want to tell someone because I'm scared that I'm going to turn up floating in a river one day and that will be the end of it,” he told him.",441,80,64
15253,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"To demonstrate what was at stake, he played Galindo one of his recordings. On the tape, Correa could be heard talking about Galindo, discussing how to persuade him to give up his campaign against an allegedly corrupt deal. The recording stunned Galindo. “I had to get out of the room to get some air. It gave me a pain in my chest,” he told me. Once he regained composure, he played the recording again, and again, until he had listened to it more than a dozen times. “It was like lifting the blindfold and being confronted with reality. How things really work.”",562,102,64

After that, the pair lost contact. As Correa moved on to other ventures, Peñas and Galindo were busy transcribing the interviews and preparing the complaint they would take to the the police. Finally, on 6 November 2007, they went to the offices of the financial crimes unit of the Spanish police and handed them a CD containing almost 18 hours of recordings, transcriptions and a list of 30 names of people involved.

Dozens of suspects would be placed under investigation for a range of charges including bribing public officials, money laundering and belonging to a criminal organisation. Many of those arrested were respected public figures. One had even been vice-president of Spain's state oil giant Repsol, although he had left the company years before his arrest. (In 2018 he was sentenced to three years in prison for tax fraud.)",667,104,64
15264,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Six days after the raids, on 12 February 2009, the PP held a press conference to deny the party's involvement in any wrongdoing. In fact, they went much further, claiming to be victims of a leftwing conspiracy. The Gürtel case, they claimed, was an unprecedented partisan attack on the party, masterminded by the controversial judge Baltasar Garzón and ministers from the Socialist party, which was in power at the time. “This is not a PP plot,” said Mariano Rajoy, who was then leader of the PP. “This is a plot against the People's party.”",541,94,64
15265,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"In the years after the investigation went public, the PP did everything possible to stymie its progress, bringing multiple complaints against prosecutors, police and judges involved in the case. “All of us, in one form or another, felt the breath of power on the back of our necks,” Garzón told me.",298,51,64
15266,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Peñas felt the threat almost immediately. Within days of the arrests, and despite the investigation being sealed by court order, it was leaked that he was the whistleblower behind the recordings. In conservative Majadahonda there were many who viewed Peñas not as a whistleblower, but as a rat, an agent of a plot to bring down the PP. On the street, people sometimes harangued or spat at him. He began receiving threatening phone calls at home. In one incident later that year, Peñas told me, his wife, Raquel, was driving home with their two young children, when she was forced off the road by another vehicle, swerving into a ditch. The three passengers were terrified but unharmed. Around 2am the following morning, a man telephoned their home. Next time, the voice told Peñas, his wife would fall from a greater height. Peñas, mistrustful of the police, did not report the incident.",887,151,64
15267,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Other whistleblowers experienced similar harassment. “For me it's been like a horror film,” said Ana Garrido, a former civil servant who reported allegations of corruption in commuter town Boadilla del Monte in 2009.

15268,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"With new, sordid details constantly seeping into the press, the Gürtel case spent years on the front pages. Newspapers reported how Correa would count envelopes of cash in full view at dinner, organise sex parties for politicians and spend so much time at a nearby brothel that they dubbed it “the office”. The men who had allegedly conspired with Correa were often referred to not by their real names, but by the colourful pseudonyms that would come to define the case in the public imagination: The Rat, The Meatball, The Moustache, Luis the Bastard.",552,94,64
15270,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"The revelations came as the economic crisis began to take hold, galvanising anger about corruption. In 2011, unemployment reached 22%. Almost one in two young people were out of work. In May 2011, protesters, most of them young, began occupying plazas in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia to protest bank bailouts, austerity and corruption. They were known as the indignados, the outraged ones. More than 6 million people took part over weeks of protests. National surveys showed overwhelming support for the movement, which transcended traditional party lines. A generation of young people with few job prospects began questioning the assumptions that had underpinned Spain's young democracy. “Gürtel was the ‘emperor has no clothes' moment for Spain,” said Carlos Delclós, a former indignados activist and author of a book on the movement and its political inheritor, Podemos. “Gürtel made it clear that it was not specific cases of corruption but that it was systemic. That corruption was the system.”",1001,157,64
15271,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Despite the anger, many voters continued to back the PP, persuaded by claims that the then-Socialist government was orchestrating the whole investigation. In the snap general election of November 2011, with the nation at risk of defaulting on its debt and facing the prospect of requiring a Greece-style bailout, Spain voted resoundingly for the PP, led by Mariano Rajoy. Back in power and enjoying an absolute majority, the PP embarked on an aggressive series of cuts to reduce the deficit and rein in Spain's spiralling debt, despite warnings it would increase hardship for many.",581,94,64
15272,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"But the Gürtel case wouldn't die. As investigators searched for stolen money, the case expanded to cover 15 countries. At home, police began finding Correa's fingerprints on more and more seemingly suspect deals. One spin-off investigation, now awaiting sentencing, accuses Correa and several co-defendants of bribery and rigging a tender for state-owned airport operating giant Aena. Another ongoing investigation is examining allegations that Correa and a former PP politician, who denies wrongdoing, conspired to defraud the taxpayer in a deal to provide audiovisual equipment used for Pope Benedict's 2006 visit to Valencia.",628,92,64
15273,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Between 2012 and 2014, at the height of austerity, it seemed as if everywhere you looked some previously respectable representative was on trial for stealing public money. Even the royal family, it seemed, were at it: a corruption scandal centred on the then king's son-in-law, Iñaki Urdangarin, threw the monarchy into disrepute. In 2014, the once popular King Juan Carlos abdicated, citing health reasons, amid a sharp decline in popularity. (Last year, Urdangarin was sentenced to six years in jail for tax fraud and embezzlement.)",534,85,64

Money came in, Bárcenas later claimed in court, as large donations from businesses, and was redistributed, in cash payments in the tens of thousands which were delivered personally in envelopes of €500 notes to certain senior PP figures.",514,84,64
15275,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Voters were shocked by just how brazen politicians and businessmen seemed to have been. Before being jailed in 2013 for tax fraud, one PP politician in Valencia won the lottery five times. (He denies wrongdoing, claiming he was merely very lucky.)

15277,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Wearing a brown jacket and red tie over a white shirt, Correa walked into the court as a small cluster of protesters yelled insults. In the years after his arrest, Correa had become a national pariah, mockingly referred to by the nickname he reportedly gave himself years earlier: “Don Vito”, a homage to the mafia boss in The Godfather. Obsessed from an early age with escaping the financial misfortune that befell his family, he was now broke. He spent three years in pre-trial jail, unable to afford bail, which was reportedly set at €85m.",542,94,64
15278,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"In court, Correa provided details of his working relationship with the PP. He would take suitcases full of cash to party headquarters, he said, never passing through reception but entering with a special access card that allowed him to come and go discreetly. “[The PP HQ] was my home,” he said. “I spent more time there than I did in my own office.”",350,63,64
15280,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"As with many of the 37 defendants, who sat in clusters of rival groups, Correa appeared largely unmoved by proceedings. He and Crespo both maintained their innocence, and spent the trial whispering to each other like schoolkids in detention. But Correa did seem visibly hurt by the way Peñas had betrayed him. “I don't have the words to describe it,” he told the court. “You'd have to be filled with such wickedness to be living in my house, […] and meanwhile recording me so that he can report me to the police.” After Peñas took the stand in December 2016, during a recess Correa challenged him in front of several onlookers. “You're shameless,” he told his former friend. “You were filling your pockets.” In response, Peñas, remaining silent, raised his hands and placed them together to mimic someone in handcuffs.",818,140,64
15281,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"In June 2017, nine months after testimony began, one of the final witnesses took the stand: the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. Although Rajoy was not accused of any crimes, it was a humiliating scene for him, the first sitting prime minister to be called to trial as a witness. Correa's testimony and the evidence of Bárcenas's ledger of payments in and out of the party slush fund had pushed him into a corner – among the names listed in that ledger was a certain “M Rajoy”. In a series of terse exchanges with a prosecution lawyer, Rajoy denied any knowledge of his party's involvement in the scheme. He also denied knowing Correa or receiving off-the-book cash payments.",673,117,64
15282,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"On 24 May 2018, after six months of deliberation, the court finally handed down the sentences. Twenty-seven defendants – including two former PP mayors, two former treasurers, one former regional secretary of organisation, one former MP and a string of PP city councillors and party advisers – were given a total of more than 300 years of jail time. Correa, who late in the trial had admitted his guilt for some crimes and pledged to cooperate with prosecutors, was sentenced to a total of almost 52 years in prison on multiple counts of bribery, money laundering, tax fraud and misappropriation of public funds. His number two, Crespo, was also found guilty of charges including bribery, money laundering and fraud and sentenced to more than 37 years in prison.",762,128,64
15283,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"For the PP, the verdict was devastating: the party itself was convicted as a direct beneficiary of the Gürtel scheme. The court found that ever since the party was founded, it had maintained a parallel accounting system to collect money from kickbacks that could be used to fund the party. The court said the testimony of Rajoy and other PP figures who denied knowing about the existence of the slush fund were “not credible”. The reputational damage was far worse than the actual punishment, which amounted to a fine of just €240,000. (The sentence would have been considerably harsher if the case was tried today, after a 2015 change in the law made illegal party financing a crime.)",685,118,64
15284,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"Within days of the verdict, the Socialist party called a no-confidence vote in Rajoy. On 31 May, with defeat seeming inevitable, Rajoy and his closest allies skipped out on the parliamentary debate about whether he should continue to lead the country. Instead, they went to a restaurant near the presidential palace, where they remained holed up for eight hours, reportedly eating sirloin steak and drinking whiskey while the press laid siege. At 10pm Rajoy, bleary-eyed, left the restaurant to the flashes of a horde of waiting photographers. The next day, parliament ousted Rajoy's administration in a vote of no confidence – a first in post-Franco Spain – and in its place, the Socialists formed a minority government.",721,117,64
15285,929,Spain's Watergate: inside the corruption scandal that changed a nation,Fraud,"In the long decade between Peñas going to the police and Rajoy's downfall, the courts made slow progress, but public opinion shifted much faster. Before the crisis, satisfaction with the political system in Spain was among the highest in Europe, behind only Denmark, Luxembourg and Finland. After 2010, in the wake of austerity and endless corruption scandals, trust in institutions such as political parties and banks crumbled. Gürtel, like Watergate, has convinced many voters to take a conspiratorial view of politics. When a courthouse in Valencia that heard part of the Gürtel trial suffered a fire in 2017, there were immediate suspicions of foul play, and social-media hoaxes spread the theory that evidence in other PP corruption cases had been destroyed. A subsequent investigation found the fire was caused by an electrical fault.",840,133,64
